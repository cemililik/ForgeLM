"""Phase 24 — `tools/check_bilingual_parity.py` regression tests.

The bilingual parity tool is a CI gate: a regression that silently
under-reports drift would let a mirror skew without anyone noticing.
We pin the recognition contracts that the CI gate's correctness rests
on:

1. Heading extraction skips fenced code blocks.
2. Heading-shaped lines INSIDE a fenced block are NOT treated as
   headings (otherwise ``# noqa: E402`` in a Python snippet would
   register as an H1).
3. Identical H2/H3/H4 spines pass; any drift fails (count diff,
   reorder, depth change, missing-mirror).
4. ``--strict`` flips the exit code; advisory mode reports anyway.
5. The canonical pair set in the repo passes ``--strict`` against
   the live filesystem (the same gate CI runs).
