## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-14

Phase 14 (Multi-Stage Pipeline Chains) closes the "operators have to write
shell wrappers to chain SFT → DPO → GRPO" gap that's lived in the issue
queue since v0.4.  One YAML, one CLI invocation, one Annex IV manifest for
the whole chain — including auto-chained inputs, per-stage gates,
crash-safe resume, and 7 new pipeline-scoped audit events that join on a
single top-level `run_id`.  The release also lands a critical SSRF
hardening for outbound webhook / judge / synthetic destinations (issue
#14).  Single-stage configs reach `forgelm/trainer.py` byte-identical to
v0.6.0; the orchestrator module is never imported when no `pipeline:`
block is present.

### Added (Phase 14 — Multi-Stage Pipeline Chains)

- **`pipeline:` config block** at the root of `ForgeConfig` chains
  one or more training stages (typically SFT → DPO → GRPO) into one
  config-driven run.  New Pydantic models `PipelineStage` and
  `PipelineConfig` enforce stage-name uniqueness, `^[a-z0-9_]{1,32}$`
  identifier shape, **at least 1 stage** (`min_length=1` — single-stage
  ergonomics are still better served by omitting the `pipeline:`
  block, but the schema accepts a 1-element pipeline so an operator
  can iterate up to a multi-stage chain without re-shaping the YAML),
  and explicit-`trainer_type` audit-clarity validation per stage.  Section-wholesale inheritance:
  `model` / `lora` / `training` / `data` / `evaluation` blocks
  inherit from the root if omitted or fully replace it when set.
  `distributed` / `webhook` / `compliance` / `risk_assessment` /
  `monitoring` / `retention` / `synthetic` / `merge` / `auth` are
  root-only and rejected per-stage with `EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR (1)`.
- **`forgelm/cli/_pipeline.py` orchestrator** drives the chain
  end-to-end.  Auto-chains each stage's `model.name_or_path` to the
  previous stage's output, persists state atomically to
  `<pipeline.output_dir>/pipeline_state.json` after every transition,
  and emits 7 new audit events: `pipeline.started`,
  `pipeline.stage_started`, `pipeline.stage_completed`,
  `pipeline.stage_gated` (when a stage exits
  `EXIT_AWAITING_APPROVAL` — review-cycle F-N-1),
  `pipeline.stage_reverted`, `pipeline.force_resume` (operator-
  approved stale-config override — review-cycle F-B-2), and
  `pipeline.completed`.  Every entry's top-level `run_id` is pinned
  to the pipeline run id (review-cycle final-round F-B-1).  Existing
  `training.*` per-stage events from `ForgeTrainer` are preserved —
  pre-existing Slack / Teams dashboards filtering on `training.failure`
  keep working unchanged.
- **CLI flags** `--stage <name>` (single-stage filter for audit /
  re-run), `--resume-from <name>` (stage-boundary resume),
  `--force-resume` (stale-config-hash override), and `--input-model
  <path>` (auto-chain escape hatch, recorded with `input_source:
  cli_override` in the audit log).
- **`--dry-run` multi-stage validation** — when the config carries a
  `pipeline:` block, dry-run validates every stage's merged config +
  the chain-integrity assertion (stage N's auto-chained input is
  under stage N-1's `output_dir`).  Errors are collected before
  exiting (à la `pytest --collectonly`).
- **Pipeline Annex IV manifest** — `compliance/pipeline_manifest.json`
  at `<pipeline.output_dir>` indexes per-stage `training_manifest.json`
  files into one verifiable chain artefact, carrying
  `pipeline_run_id` + `pipeline_config_hash` (SHA-256 of the YAML
  bytes) for reproducibility.  `forgelm verify-annex-iv --pipeline
  <run_dir>` walks the index, checks chain integrity, and asserts
  every referenced per-stage manifest exists on disk.
- **Webhook notifications** — `WebhookNotifier.notify_pipeline_started`,
  `notify_pipeline_completed`, and `notify_pipeline_reverted`
  mirror the orchestrator's audit events; gated by the existing
  `notify_on_start` / `notify_on_success` / `notify_on_failure`
  config flags so operators silencing per-stage events also silence
  the pipeline-level pings.
- **Bilingual operator guide** — new `docs/guides/pipeline.md` +
  `docs/guides/pipeline-tr.md` (canonical "first pipeline" walkthrough,
  inheritance matrix, CLI semantics, Annex IV verifier flow,
  Limitations section).  `config_template.yaml` gains a commented-out
  `pipeline:` example block.

### Changed (Phase 14)

- **Backward compatibility preserved.**  A config file without a
  `pipeline:` key reaches `forgelm/trainer.py` byte-identically to
  v0.6.0; the orchestrator module is never imported.
- `compliance.py` exports four new symbols: `generate_pipeline_manifest`
  (called by the orchestrator after every transition),
  `export_pipeline_manifest` (atomic write to
  `<pipeline.output_dir>/compliance/pipeline_manifest.json`),
  `verify_pipeline_manifest(manifest: dict) -> List[str]` (in-memory
  structural + chain-integrity check, returns a list of human-readable
  violations — empty when valid), and `verify_pipeline_manifest_at_path
  (pipeline_dir: str) -> List[str]` (disk-backed wrapper used by the
  `forgelm verify-annex-iv --pipeline <dir>` CLI mode).  The shared
  validator lives in private helper `_verify_manifest_payload` so the
  in-memory and disk-bound entry points cannot drift.

### Fixed (Phase 14 review-response — PR #53)

Addresses the consolidated reviewer-pass findings (3 blocking +
4 significant + Gemini's 3 inline comments) against the initial Phase
14 merge candidate:

- **F-B-1** — `forgelm --config pipeline.yaml --dry-run` now reaches
  the pipeline orchestrator's per-stage validator instead of the
  legacy single-stage dry-run path; the `_dispatch.py` ordering was
  inverted (no-train-mode ran before the pipeline branch).
- **F-B-2** — `--force-resume` now emits a `pipeline.force_resume`
  audit event carrying `old_config_hash` + `new_config_hash` so
  compliance reviewers can distinguish an operator-approved override
  from a normal resume (was previously a WARNING log only —
  invisible in the append-only JSONL stream).
- **F-B-3** — pipeline manifest verifier now compares every chain
  stage against its **immediate** predecessor, not the most-recent
  stage with an `output_model`.  Pre-fix, a manifest where stage N-1
  failed without saving an `output_model` could appear to chain
  stage N from stage N-2, masking the broken link.
- **F-F-1 / F-G-3 (Gemini)** — auto-chain existence guard now
  checks the resolved model directory itself, not its parent — used
  to accept `./stage1/` even when `./stage1/final_model` was
  missing.
- **F-F-2** — `--input-model ""` (empty string) is normalised to
  `None` at dispatch time so it no longer slips past the truthy
  guard and silently overwrites the auto-chained model path with an
  empty string.
- **F-F-3** — `_validate_resume_state` now returns its refusal
  through the normal `run()` flow instead of `sys.exit`-ing mid-method,
  so every refusal path emits the same audit-log finalisation and
  the test surface uses one uniform `assert code == EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR`
  shape.
- **F-S-2 / F-N-2** — verifier surfaces stages still in `running`
  status on a finalised manifest as a `chain_integrity_violation`
  candidate (a tell of a crashed orchestrator).  Also `_load_state_file`
  catches `KeyError` / `TypeError` / `ValueError` / `AttributeError`
  around `_deserialise_state` so a tampered state file produces an
  actionable config error rather than a Python traceback.
- **F-N-1** — gated stages now emit a dedicated
  `pipeline.stage_gated` audit event (was `pipeline.stage_completed`
  with a `gate_decision=approval_pending` sub-field).  Lets
  dashboard / SIEM filters distinguish the gate flow on the event
  name alone.
- **F-G-1 (Gemini)** — pipeline dry-run now flags `training.output_dir`
  collisions across stages (two stages writing to the same dir would
  silently overwrite each other's checkpoints + per-stage Annex IV
  manifests).  Covers both the explicit-override and inherited-from-
  root collision cases.

### Security

- **Webhook / judge / synthetic SSRF guard — DNS-rebinding TOCTOU
  hardening (issue #14).** Pre-fix, `_is_private_destination()`
  pre-resolved the hostname and `requests.post()` then ran its own
  DNS lookup at connect time; an attacker-controlled DNS server with
  TTL=0 could return a public IP on the first lookup (passing the
  guard) and a private IP on the second (when `requests` connected),
  leaking the payload + bearer token to a private destination
  (loopback, RFC1918, or cloud IMDS at `169.254.169.254`). New
  `_resolve_safe_destination()` helper resolves the hostname exactly
  once and `safe_post` / `safe_get` rebuild the outbound URL with the
  returned public IP literal so `requests` never re-resolves. The
  original hostname is preserved via the `Host` header (and SNI for
  HTTPS) using
  `requests_toolbelt.adapters.host_header_ssl.HostHeaderSSLAdapter`
  so virtual-hosted endpoints (Slack / Teams / Discord) and
  certificate validation still work correctly. `allow_private=True`
  callers (operator-blessed internal destinations) keep the legacy
  flow so split-horizon DNS / in-cluster resolution still works.
  `requests-toolbelt>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` is now a hard dependency.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-11

Phase 15 (Ingestion Pipeline Reliability) Wave 1 + Wave 2. Closes the
silent-failure gap the 2026-05-11 pilot exposed across PDF / DOCX /
EPUB / TXT / MD ingestion plus the user-facing playground notebook.
Five review-absorption rounds (Gemini / CodeRabbit / Sonar / Codacy +
independent self-review) ship in the same release.

### Added (Phase 15 Wave 1)

- **`forgelm/_pypdf_normalise.py`** — Turkish glyph normalisation
  profile (`turkish` default, `none` opt-out, future-pluggable
  `--normalise-profile`) mapping the audit-measured pypdf font-fallback
  artefacts (`ø Õ ú ÷ ࡟` → `İ ı ş ğ •`) back to their correct Turkish
  characters at chunk-write time.
- **`forgelm/_script_sanity.py`** — language-aware Unicode-block sanity
  check (`tr` / `en` / `de` / `fr` / `es` / `it` / `pt`) that fires a
  WARNING + structured `script_sanity_summary` block when the out-of-
  script ratio exceeds the calibrated 1.5 % threshold. Catches both
  pypdf font corruption and TXT encoding mis-routing.
- **`forgelm ingest --language-hint LANG`** + `--script-sanity-threshold`
  + `--normalise-profile {turkish,none}` + `--no-normalise-unicode` CLI
  flags wiring Tasks 2 + 3 to the operator surface.
- **`forgelm ingest` end-of-run quality pre-signal (Task 4)** — three
  cheap row-level checks (alpha-ratio, weird-char ratio, repeated-line
  ratio) emitting `[WARN] N/M chunks below ingestion quality threshold`
  + a structured `quality_presignal` block in `notes_structured`. Opt
  out via `--no-quality-presignal`.
- **`forgelm doctor` pypdf-normalise diagnostic (`pypdf_normalise.turkish`)**
  — confirms the glyph-normalisation table loaded and round-trips
  cleanly without running a test ingest.
- **DOCX explicit header / footer extraction (Task 6)** — `_extract_docx`
  reads `doc.sections[i].header.paragraphs` + `.footer.paragraphs` and
  subtracts those lines from the body before chunking.
- **EPUB spine-order + nav / cover / copyright skip (Task 7)** —
  `_extract_epub` iterates `book.spine` (reading order) instead of
  file order; default skip-list (`nav`, `cover`, `copyright`,
  `colophon`, `titlepage`, `frontmatter`) opt-out via
  `--epub-no-skip-frontmatter`.
- **TXT UTF-8 BOM strip + MD YAML frontmatter detection (Task 8)** —
  `_extract_text` / new `_extract_markdown` strip the BOM via
  `encoding="utf-8-sig"` and detect `---\n...\n---\n` YAML frontmatter;
  `--keep-md-frontmatter` opts back in.
- **`forgelm/ingestion.strip_paragraph_packed_headers`** — second-pass
  dedup against paragraph-packed text catches header lines that
  survived the page-level pass.
- **`tests/test_ingestion_reliability.py`** — 36 regression tests
  locking the Wave 1 + Wave 2 behaviour across PDF / DOCX / EPUB /
  TXT / MD fixtures.

### Added (Phase 15 Wave 2)

- **`forgelm ingest --strip-pattern REGEX` (Task 11)** — operator-
  controlled regex stripping with ReDoS guard. Patterns are
  structurally validated at CLI-parse time (rejects nested unbounded
  quantifiers like `(a+)+b` and `.*?` + back-reference under DOTALL
  per the SonarCloud `python:S5852` shape rule), wrapped in a 5-second
  per-pattern SIGALRM budget on POSIX. Opt out of the timeout via
  `--strip-pattern-no-timeout`.
- **`forgelm ingest --page-range START-END` (Task 12)** — restrict
  PDF extraction to a contiguous page slice (1-indexed inclusive).
  Validation failures (`start < 1`, `start > end`,
  `start > page_count`) abort the run with `EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR` via a
  new `IngestParameterError(ValueError)` that bypasses the per-file
  soft-fail catch.
- **PDF front-matter / back-matter heuristic (Task 13, default ON)** —
  three-signal heuristic (alpha < 0.45 + underscore > 0.10 + ≥ 5
  inline page-number matches) drops up to 12 leading + 12 trailing
  pages and emits a WARNING + `frontmatter_pages_dropped` field in
  `notes_structured`. Opt out via `--keep-frontmatter`.
- **`forgelm ingest --strip-urls {keep,mask,strip}` (Task 14)** —
  detected URLs are masked with `[URL]`, stripped outright, or kept
  (default). Independent of `--all-mask` (URL handling is a
  content-shape decision, not a GDPR redaction).
- **PDF multi-column layout warning (Task 15)** — samples the first
  three pages' Tj-text positions via pypdf's `visitor_text` callback,
  fires a WARNING when a > 30 %-of-page-width two-cluster gap is
  detected. No fix attempt — operator switches strategy / pre-
  processes externally.

### Changed (Phase 15)

- **`forgelm audit --quality-filter` is now default-ON in v0.6.0**
  (Task 5). Pre-v0.6.0 invocations with explicit `--quality-filter`
  keep identical behaviour. Operators wanting the pre-v0.6.0 opt-in
  semantics pass the new `--no-quality-filter` companion flag.
- **`_strip_repeating_page_lines` window-based dedup (Task 1)** —
  replaces the pre-Phase-15 outermost-row-only iteration. Catches
  variable-outer-line + constant-deeper-line corpora (the audit §1.1
  trap) by inspecting the top-3 / bottom-3 rows per page on every
  pass. A second pass runs after paragraph packing to mop up survivor
  headers.
- **`notebooks/ingestion_playground.ipynb` (Task 9)** — Cell 5 exposes
  `CHUNK_TOKENS` + `TOKENIZER` + `LANGUAGE_HINT` knobs; Cell 8 markdown
  explains the new quality-filter checks; Cell 9 passes
  `--quality-filter` explicitly for forward-compat across v0.5 → v0.6;
  Cell 10 pretty-prints the `quality_summary` block alongside the
  existing PII / secrets / near-duplicate / language sections.
- **`IngestionResult` schema** — additive Phase 15 fields:
  `pdf_paragraph_packed_lines_stripped`, `script_sanity_triggered`,
  `strip_pattern_substitutions`, `urls_handled`,
  `frontmatter_pages_dropped`. No pre-Phase-15 key was renamed.

### Fixed (Phase 15 review-absorption — 5 rounds)

Five review-absorption rounds (Gemini + CodeRabbit + Sonar + Codacy +
independent self-review) shipped in the same release. Highlights:

- **`forgelm/cli/_training.py::_preflight_numpy_torch_abi`** — any
  unexpected exception from the underlying probe (corrupted torch
  install where `torch.__version__` raises `AttributeError`, etc.)
  is now caught and converted into a structured
  `abi_preflight_crashed` JSON envelope. Previously the raw Python
  traceback would pre-empt the `--output-format json` contract that
  every other CLI failure path honours. Exit code stays
  `EXIT_TRAINING_ERROR` (= 2), matching the broken-ABI verdict so
  CI/CD branching doesn't need to distinguish "ABI bad" from "ABI
  probe died".
- **`forgelm ingest --language-hint`** — a hint outside
  `forgelm._script_sanity.SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` (e.g. `zh`) now
  triggers a WARNING at CLI dispatch time naming the supported codes
  instead of silently no-opping the script-sanity layer. Round-5
  self-review C-B finding.
- **EPUB skip-list whole-token match** — `recovery.xhtml` no longer
  matches `cover` via substring; `_epub_item_matches_skip` splits
  filenames + EPUB-3 manifest properties on path/extension/separator
  characters and matches whole tokens. Skipped items emit a WARNING
  naming the affected files. Round-1 C-1 + round-3 S-C findings.
- **Default `normalise_profile`** flipped from `"turkish"` to
  `"none"`; CLI dispatcher + library `ingest_path` both auto-derive
  `"turkish"` only when `--language-hint tr` is set. Prevents silent
  rewrites of legitimate non-Turkish letters (Norwegian `ø`,
  Estonian `Õ`, math `÷`). Round-1 C-2 finding.
- **ReDoS validator** caught escape-shape variants (`(\w+)+x`,
  `(\d+)+x`, `(\s+)+x`, `(\w+\s+)+x`) the pre-round-1 backward-walk
  validator skipped, and now clamps the per-pattern SIGALRM to
  `min(timeout_s, previous_remaining)` so nested calls cannot
  extend an outer caller's deadline. Round-1 S-1 + round-2 alarm
  clamp findings.
- **Operator-controlled-string injection vector** in
  `IngestParameterError` / decrypt-fail / `Could not open PDF`
  messages — paths now repr-escape via `{path!r}` so ANSI escape
  sequences / control chars / embedded quotes cannot leak into the
  rendered error. Round-4 C-A finding.
- **Quality-presignal false positive on clean small corpora** —
  chunks below 80 non-whitespace characters skip the alpha-ratio
  check so a 5-paragraph 41-char TXT no longer emits
  `[WARN] 1/1 chunks below ingestion quality threshold`. Round-4
  C-B finding.
- **Front-matter heuristic** dot-leader detection
  (`r"[._]{3,}"`), denominator parity with `alpha_ratio` (non-
  whitespace chars), and alpha threshold tightened 0.45 → 0.30.
  Catches dotted-leader ToCs the pre-round-3 underscore-only count
  missed; protects realistic form templates via the 3-signal AND
  filter. Round-3 + round-4 + round-5 findings.

### Fixed (other — earlier review absorption)

- **`forgelm/cli/_training.py::_preflight_numpy_torch_abi`** — any
  unexpected exception from the underlying probe (corrupted torch
  install where `torch.__version__` raises `AttributeError`, etc.)
  is now caught and converted into a structured
  `abi_preflight_crashed` JSON envelope. Previously the raw Python
  traceback would pre-empt the `--output-format json` contract that
  every other CLI failure path honours. Exit code stays
  `EXIT_TRAINING_ERROR` (= 2), matching the broken-ABI verdict so
  CI/CD branching doesn't need to distinguish "ABI bad" from "ABI
  probe died".
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — exit-code contract was stated as `0/1/2/3/4`,
  but the canonical table in `docs/standards/error-handling.md`
  documented `0/1/2/3/4/5` since v0.5.5 (Phase 22 added
  `EXIT_WIZARD_CANCELLED = 5`). CLAUDE.md now matches the actual
  contract — the standard was right, the agent guidance was stale.
- **`docs/roadmap/completed-phases.md::Phase 12` summary** — Tier 1
  status line claimed a `[ingestion-secrets]` extra "via
  `detect-secrets` with regex fallback", but that extra was never
  published; only `[ingestion-pii-ml]` exists in `pyproject.toml`'s
  extras surface. Reworded to record the historical plan accurately
  ("`detect-secrets` integration was originally planned as a
  `[ingestion-secrets]` extra but deferred — only
  `[ingestion-pii-ml]` ultimately shipped"). Pure docs accuracy fix.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-05-11

Patch release on top of `v0.5.6`. Two production blockers and one UX
gap that bit Intel Mac operators:

1. **SFT trainer `TypeError`** on modern `trl` (0.13 + 1.x). trl 0.13
   renamed `SFTConfig.max_seq_length` → `max_length` and removed the
   old kwarg; v0.5.6 was still passing `max_seq_length` unconditionally,
   so `forgelm --config <yaml>` crashed with
   `TypeError: SFTConfig.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument
   'max_seq_length'` on any environment that pulled a current trl
   wheel (notably the Colab default `pip install forgelm` path).
2. **NumPy 2.x ↔ torch 2.2 binary-ABI mismatch** exposed by the v0.5.6
   Intel Mac torch revert. With `torch>=2.2.0` as the floor and no
   upper-pin on numpy, pip resolved `numpy>=2` on Intel Mac (x86_64)
   hosts; torch 2.2 was compiled against NumPy 1.x and silently
   degraded its numpy bridge with `_ARRAY_API not found`.
3. **Operator UX:** the cryptic `NameError: name '_C' is not defined`
   that surfaced from the ABI mismatch would previously bite
   mid-training with no actionable hint. v0.5.7 ships a doctor probe
   and a training-pipeline preflight so the operator gets a single-line
   `pip install 'numpy<2'` remediation instead.

Release engineering: this patch absorbs five review rounds against
PRs #44 / #45 — the SFT + ABI fixes are listed under **Fixed** below;
the UX additions (preflight + doctor probe + JSON-envelope contract +
shared `_abi_check` helper) are under **Added**; pure test/CI
hardening (the `sys.modules` pollution cascade fix, the new CI guard,
pytest-randomly adoption) is under **Internal**.

### Added

- **`forgelm doctor` — `numpy.torch_abi` probe.** New diagnostic
  inspects torch + numpy major-version pairing and emits a `fail`
  with a `pip install 'numpy<2'` remediation hint when a torch < 2.3
  install is paired with NumPy ≥ 2 (the canonical Intel Mac install
  failure mode). Probe imports torch / numpy with warnings suppressed
  so the probe itself does not emit a duplicate Python `UserWarning`
  (the underlying torch C++ `fprintf(stderr, "_ARRAY_API not found",
  …)` message is outside Python's warnings machinery and cannot be
  intercepted from a long-lived CLI process — documented honestly in
  the probe docstring). Surfaces in the
  `forgelm doctor --output-format json` envelope so CI consumers
  catch the issue programmatically.
- **Training-pipeline ABI preflight (`forgelm/cli/_training.py::_preflight_numpy_torch_abi`).**
  A shared helper at `forgelm/cli/_abi_check.py` runs the same probe
  as `forgelm doctor`, and `_run_training_pipeline` now calls it
  before importing the heavy stack. An operator who hits a residual
  Intel Mac NumPy 2 mismatch (env drift, out-of-band
  `pip install -U numpy`) now sees a single-line error with the
  exact remediation command instead of a cryptic
  `NameError: name '_C' is not defined` from torch mid-training. The
  PEP 508 marker in `pyproject.toml` is the primary fix for fresh
  installs; the preflight is the second line of defense for drifted
  environments. Any unexpected crash from the probe itself converts
  into a structured `abi_preflight_crashed` JSON envelope (same
  `EXIT_TRAINING_ERROR` = 2 class) rather than a raw Python
  traceback. The two envelope shapes (`numpy_torch_abi_mismatch` +
  `abi_preflight_crashed`) are documented in
  [`docs/usermanuals/{en,tr}/reference/json-output.md`](docs/usermanuals/en/reference/json-output.md)
  for CI consumers.

### Fixed

- **`forgelm/trainer.py::_get_training_args_for_type`** — the SFT
  branch now inspects `SFTConfig.__init__`'s signature at runtime and
  picks the correct sequence-length-cap parameter name. trl 0.13+
  (including the 1.x line) receives `max_length`; trl 0.12.x — still
  within the `pyproject.toml` floor `trl>=0.12.0,<2.0.0` — keeps
  receiving `max_seq_length`. If a future trl release exposes
  neither name as a discoverable parameter, the branch now raises
  `ValueError` (not warn-and-continue) listing the actually-detected
  parameters — silently dropping an explicit `model.max_length` YAML
  setting would violate `docs/standards/error-handling.md` "no silent
  failures". No code change for DPO / SimPO / KTO / ORPO / GRPO
  trainers (their `*Config` parameters were not affected by the
  rename).
- **`pyproject.toml` — Intel Mac (x86_64) NumPy 2 ABI mismatch.**
  Added `numpy<2; sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine ==
  'x86_64'` so pip's resolver caps numpy at the 1.x line on the only
  platform that is wheel-locked to torch 2.2.x. Other platforms keep
  numpy unconstrained — torch 2.3+ on Linux / Apple Silicon / Windows
  is binary-compatible with NumPy 2.x. Affected `pip install forgelm`
  users on Intel Mac since the v0.5.6 torch revert.

### Internal

- **Test-pollution cascade fix.** Three pre-existing tests
  (`tests/test_doctor.py` × 2, `tests/test_quickstart_compat.py` × 1)
  popped `sys.modules['torch']` / `sys.modules['numpy']` without
  restoring them; the stranded modules half-initialised every
  subsequent `import torch` in the pytest session (`torch._C` never
  re-bound), causing every downstream `from trl import SFTConfig` and
  a long tail of merging / moe / quickstart / wizard / judge / safety
  tests to fail in the full suite even though they passed in isolation
  (35 spurious failures observed on the Intel Mac dev box). Swapped
  for `monkeypatch.delitem` so the modules are auto-restored on test
  teardown.
- **New CI guard `tools/check_no_unguarded_sys_modules_pop.py`** —
  fails on any `sys.modules.pop("torch"|"numpy"|"trl"|…)` or
  `del sys.modules["…"]` without `monkeypatch.delitem`. Wired into
  the self-review gauntlet (`CLAUDE.md`) and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  so the regression class becomes impossible to silently re-introduce.
- **`pytest-randomly>=3.15.0,<4.0.0` added to `[dev]` extra.**
  Shuffles test order per session so order-dependent bugs (the
  failure mode above) surface in CI instead of waiting for a Python
  micro-bump or runner change to flip collection. Reproduce a
  specific shuffle with `pytest --randomly-seed=<n>`.
- **`forgelm/cli/_abi_check.py`** — new shared helper module carries
  the ABI verdict + remediation logic. Both the doctor probe and the
  training preflight consume it as a single source of truth. Includes
  a `(0, 0)` parse-fallback short-circuit so corporate forks with
  non-semver torch / numpy tags can't trip a false-positive
  `ABI_BROKEN`.
- **`forgelm/cli/subcommands/_doctor.py::_check_numpy_torch_abi`**
  refactored to call into the shared helper rather than duplicating
  the version-parsing + threshold logic. Exhaustive-enum guard at the
  end now `raise`s `RuntimeError` instead of `assert`-ing, so
  `python -O` doesn't strip the check.
- **Documentation hygiene.** `CLAUDE.md` exit-code contract line now
  reads `0/1/2/3/4/5` to match the canonical table in
  `docs/standards/error-handling.md` (the standard had documented
  `EXIT_WIZARD_CANCELLED = 5` since v0.5.5; the agent guidance was
  stale). `docs/roadmap/completed-phases.md` Phase 12 Tier 1 status
  line no longer advertises a `[ingestion-secrets]` extra that was
  never published — only `[ingestion-pii-ml]` exists. One leftover
  `(Faz 12)` Turkish residue in the v0.5.2 CHANGELOG entry rewritten
  to `(Phase 12)`.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-05-10

**Status:** Released to PyPI 2026-05-10 via the cross-OS publish
workflow ([`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml))
which gates PyPI publish on 12 wheel-install matrix combos
(3 OS × 4 Python). GitHub Release:
[v0.5.6](https://github.com/cemililik/ForgeLM/releases/tag/v0.5.6).

Patch release. Reverts the v0.5.5 `torch>=2.3.0` minimum back to
`torch>=2.2.0` to restore Intel Mac (x86_64) installability. The
`torch>=2.3` floor in v0.5.5 was inaccurate — no v2.3-specific
PyTorch API is referenced in production code. The single citation
in `tests/test_grpo_reward.py` is a comment explaining the test's
graceful skip when `trl.GRPOTrainer`'s lazy import fails on a
torch/trl mismatch; the skip pattern
(`pytest.mark.skipif(not grpo_patchable, ...)`) already handles that
case across torch 2.2 + 2.3. Production FSDP usage in
`forgelm/trainer.py` delegates string options to
`transformers.TrainingArguments` and never imports
`torch.distributed.fsdp.FSDPModule` directly.

### Changed

- **`pyproject.toml`** — `torch>=2.3.0,<3.0.0` →
  `torch>=2.2.0,<3.0.0`. Other dependencies untouched.

### Fixed

- **`pip install forgelm` silently downgrading to v0.5.0 on Intel
  Mac (x86_64) hosts.** The PyTorch Foundation stopped publishing
  `torch>=2.3` wheels for Intel Mac (only Apple Silicon / Linux /
  Windows wheels exist for 2.3+). v0.5.5's `torch>=2.3.0` requirement
  caused pip's resolver to silently fall back to v0.5.0 (which
  pinned `torch>=2.1.0`) for those hosts — `pip install forgelm`
  appeared to succeed but installed a year-old version with no
  GDPR / Library API / operational subcommands. v0.5.6 lowers the
  floor to `torch>=2.2.0`, the highest minor available across all
  supported platforms (including Intel Mac × Python 3.11). Existing
  v0.5.0 users on Intel Mac can now upgrade with `pip install -U
  forgelm` and reach v0.5.6 cleanly.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-05-10

"Closure Cycle Bundle + Phase 22 Wizard + Site Documentation Sweep."
v0.5.5 consolidates the closure-cycle backlog (Library API, GDPR
right-of-erasure + right-of-access, ISO 27001 / SOC 2 alignment,
operational subcommands, supply-chain security, cross-OS release
matrix) and three follow-up PRs that landed before the PyPI tag was
cut (Phase 22 CLI wizard modernisation, site documentation correction
sweep, release-prep + nightly pip-audit gate fix).

### Added

#### Library API

- **Stable Python entry points for every CLI subcommand.**
  `forgelm/__init__.py` is now a strict lazy-import facade with
  PEP 562 `__getattr__`, `__dir__` enumeration of the public surface,
  a `TYPE_CHECKING` block for `mypy --strict` consumers, and per-symbol
  caching in `globals()`. `import forgelm` does not pull `torch`;
  resolved values are zero-cost on the second access. New
  `forgelm/_version.py` separates `__version__` (package) from
  `__api_version__` (Python library API contract); `forgelm/py.typed`
  marker shipped via `pyproject.toml` package-data. The `__all__`
  enumerates configuration (`load_config`, `ForgeConfig`, `ConfigError`),
  training (`ForgeTrainer`, `TrainResult`), data (`prepare_dataset`,
  `get_model_and_tokenizer`, `audit_dataset`, `AuditReport`), PII /
  secrets / dedup utilities (`detect_pii`, `mask_pii`, `detect_secrets`,
  `mask_secrets`, `compute_simhash`), compliance (`AuditLogger`,
  `verify_audit_log`, `VerifyResult`), verification toolbelt
  (`verify_annex_iv_artifact`, `VerifyAnnexIVResult`, `verify_gguf`,
  `VerifyGgufResult`), webhooks (`WebhookNotifier`), and auxiliary
  (`setup_authentication`, `manage_checkpoints`, `run_benchmark`,
  `BenchmarkResult`, `SyntheticDataGenerator`).

#### GDPR right-of-erasure (Article 17)

- **`forgelm purge`** — three-mode dispatcher:
  - `--row-id <id> --corpus <path>` — atomic JSONL row erasure with
    a SHA-256(salt + id) hashed audit event. A per-output-dir salt at
    `<output_dir>/.forgelm_audit_salt` (mode `0600`) persists
    regardless of the `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET` toggle; env-var-set
    invocations XOR the persistent salt with the secret prefix and
    record `salt_source="env_var"` so a salt-source change between
    invocations is detectable in the chain.
  - `--run-id <id> --kind {staging,artefacts}` — run-scoped artefact
    erasure (staging directory or compliance bundle).
  - `--check-policy` — read-only retention-policy violation report
    (always exits 0; report-not-gate by design).
- **`RetentionConfig`** — new Pydantic block with four horizons
  (`audit_log_retention_days=1825`, `staging_ttl_days=7`,
  `ephemeral_artefact_retention_days=90`,
  `raw_documents_retention_days=90`) and
  `enforce ∈ {log_only, warn_on_excess, block_on_excess}`.
  `EvaluationConfig.staging_ttl_days` alias-forwards to
  `retention.staging_ttl_days` with a single `DeprecationWarning`;
  conflicting values raise `ConfigError`. Removal scheduled for v0.7.0.
- **Six new `data.erasure_*` audit events** catalogued bilingually
  (three core erasure events + three operator-warning events),
  plus an operator guide at
  [`docs/guides/gdpr_erasure.md`](docs/guides/gdpr_erasure.md)
  (+ TR mirror).

#### GDPR right-of-access (Article 15)

- **`forgelm reverse-pii --query VALUE [--type literal|email|phone|tr_id|us_ssn|iban|credit_card|custom] [--salt-source per_dir|env_var] JSONL_GLOB...`** —
  walks JSONL corpora and reports every line where the supplied
  identifier appears. Two scan modes: *plaintext residual* (mask-leak
  detection) and *hash-mask* (reuses `forgelm purge`'s per-output-dir
  salt to re-derive the digest, so a purge → reverse-pii cycle for the
  same subject yields matching digests). Snippets are centred on the
  matched span and capped at 160 chars.
- **Default `--type` is `literal`** — a stray
  `--query alice@example.com` matches the literal e-mail substring,
  not the regex shape `alice@exampleXcom`. Operators wanting raw regex
  pass `--type custom` explicitly; on POSIX a 30s SIGALRM budget guards
  against ReDoS hangs.
- **New `data.access_request_query` audit event** with the identifier
  salted-and-hashed before emission so Article 15 access requests
  don't themselves leak the subject's data into the audit log.

#### Operational subcommands

- **`forgelm doctor`** — environment pre-flight: Python version,
  torch + CUDA, GPU inventory, every optional extra advertised in
  `pyproject.toml`, HuggingFace Hub reachability, workspace disk
  space, and the `FORGELM_OPERATOR` audit-identity hint. Tabular text
  or JSON envelope (`--output-format json`). `--offline` skips the
  HF Hub network probe and inspects the local cache. Honours
  `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` / `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` /
  `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1` implicitly. Heavy deps lazy-imported inside
  individual probes so `forgelm doctor` runs on a brand-new machine.
- **`forgelm cache-models --model M [--safety S] [--output DIR]`** —
  populates the HF cache via `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`.
  Cache resolution: `--output > HF_HUB_CACHE > HF_HOME/hub > ~/.cache/huggingface/hub`.
  Repeatable `--model` flag.
- **`forgelm cache-tasks --tasks CSV`** — populates the lm-eval task
  dataset cache via `lm_eval.tasks.get_task_dict` +
  `dataset.download_and_prepare()`. Requires `[eval]` extra.
- **`forgelm safety-eval --model <path> {--probes <jsonl> | --default-probes}`** —
  standalone counterpart to the training-time safety gate. Wraps
  `forgelm.safety.run_safety_evaluation`; supports HF + GGUF models
  (GGUF requires `[export]` extra). Bundled probe set at
  `forgelm/safety_prompts/default_probes.jsonl` (50 prompts × 14
  harm categories — controlled-substances, jailbreak, hate-speech,
  self-harm, csam, etc.).
- **`forgelm verify-annex-iv <path>`** — verifies an EU AI Act
  Annex IV artifact JSON: nine required field categories per
  Annex IV §1-9 + manifest-hash recompute (canonical-JSON SHA-256
  against `metadata.manifest_hash`).
  `verify_annex_iv_artifact(path) → VerifyAnnexIVResult` exposed as
  a public library function.
- **`forgelm verify-gguf <path>`** — three-layer GGUF integrity check:
  4-byte `GGUF` magic header, optional metadata parse via the `gguf`
  package, optional SHA-256 sidecar (`<path>.sha256`) comparison.
  `verify_gguf(path) → VerifyGgufResult` exposed as a public library
  function.
- **`forgelm verify-audit`** — verifies the integrity of the
  append-only audit log chain (HMAC + SHA-256). `verify_audit_log` is
  a public library function.
- **`forgelm approvals --pending`** lists every run whose audit log
  carries a `human_approval.required` event without a matching
  terminal decision; **`--show RUN_ID`** prints the full
  approval-gate audit chain plus the on-disk staging directory layout.
  Tabular text or JSON envelope. Defence-in-depth path-traversal
  guard rejects tampered staging paths outside the output directory;
  latest-wins semantics correctly classify re-staged runs as pending.
- **`forgelm approve <run_id>` / `forgelm reject <run_id>`** — manage
  the Article 14 human-approval gate. `approve` atomically renames
  `final_model.staging/` → `final_model/` (with a `shutil.move`
  fallback on cross-device output mounts), emits
  `human_approval.granted`, and fires a `notify_success` webhook.
  `reject` records `human_approval.rejected` and leaves the staging
  directory in place for forensic review. Approver identity resolves
  via `FORGELM_OPERATOR` → `getpass.getuser()` → `"anonymous"`.

#### CLI wizard parity-with-web

`forgelm --wizard` now covers the same nine user-visible stages as
the in-browser wizard at `forgelm.dev/quickstart` and produces the
same generated YAML. Internal step IDs and the trainer-vs-model order
may differ between the two surfaces by design — both flows reach an
equivalent `ForgeConfig` shape; the divergence is documented inline at
`forgelm/wizard/_orchestrator.py`. The CLI flow is welcome →
use-case → model → strategy → trainer → dataset → training-params →
compliance → evaluation, with `back` / `b` to navigate backwards and
`reset` / `r` to clear in-memory state. The wizard module was split
into a sub-package (`forgelm/wizard/`) for orchestrator / state /
collectors / BYOD / IO concerns.

- **Idempotent re-run:** `forgelm --wizard --wizard-start-from
  /path/to/existing.yaml` reads the YAML, validates it against
  `ForgeConfig` up front, and seeds the wizard with the loaded values
  so a bare Enter at every prompt keeps the operator's earlier answer.
  Save flow defaults to the same path; existing overwrite confirmation
  still fires.
- **State persistence:** snapshot at
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/forgelm/wizard_state.yaml` (or
  `~/.cache/forgelm/wizard_state.yaml`) saved after every completed
  step; resume on next launch when the snapshot is present and
  schema-compatible. Snapshot is `chmod 0o600` and cleared on
  successful completion. Atomic writes via temp file + `fsync` +
  `os.replace` prevent half-written state under SIGKILL / power loss.
- **Schema-driven defaults:** wizard-relevant fields in
  `forgelm/config.py` are flagged with
  `json_schema_extra={"wizard": True}`. A generator script
  (`tools/generate_wizard_defaults.py`) walks the schema and writes
  `forgelm/wizard/_defaults.json` (consumed by the CLI wizard via
  `importlib.resources`) and `site/js/wizard_defaults.js` (consumed
  by the web wizard's `defaultState()`). A CI guard
  (`tools/check_wizard_defaults_sync.py`) fails the run on schema-
  vs-shipped-JSON drift. Hardcoded fallbacks survive only when the
  JSON is missing entirely (broken pip install).
- **Trainer-specific hyperparameters:** `dpo_beta`, `simpo_beta` /
  `simpo_gamma`, `kto_beta`, `orpo_beta`, `grpo_num_generations`,
  `grpo_max_completion_length`, `grpo_reward_model` surface per
  `trainer_type`. SFT short-circuits.
- **PEFT method breadth:** the strategy step offers all four
  schema-supported `lora.method` values (`lora`, `dora`, `pissa`,
  `rslora`) plus GaLore as a separate axis. All six `galore_optim`
  Literal values surfaced, including the three `_layerwise` variants.
  RoPE scaling adds `longrope` (full 4-of-4 schema coverage).
- **Compliance depth:** `compliance` (Article 11 + Annex IV §1) plus
  optional `risk_assessment` (Article 9), `data.governance`
  (Article 10), `retention` (GDPR Article 5(1)(e) + 17), `monitoring`
  (Article 12 + 17), `evaluation.benchmark`, `evaluation.llm_judge`,
  `synthetic` blocks all configurable from the wizard.
- **High-risk auto-coercion:** `risk_classification ∈ {high-risk,
  unacceptable}` automatically enables `evaluation.safety` +
  `evaluation.require_human_approval` with a visible operator notice
  — front-stops the schema-side `F-compliance-110` `ConfigError`.
- **Webhook URL parsing with SSRF preflight:** single prompt accepts
  a literal URL or `env:VAR_NAME` reference; the URL is
  `urlparse`-validated, HTTPS recommended, and loopback / RFC1918 /
  link-local destinations rejected up front by reusing
  `forgelm._http._is_private_destination` so typos like
  `http://10.0.0.1/x` fail at config time instead of training time.
- **Configuration summary:** the wizard prints the full generated
  YAML alongside the labelled headline so the operator sees every
  block (webhook / evaluation / compliance / risk / retention /
  monitoring) without `cat`-ing the file.
- **Step-diff preview:** each completed step prints
  `+ key.path: value` / `~ key.path: before → after` so the operator
  sees exactly what changed mid-flow.
- **Beginner / expert toggle:** beginner mode prefixes each step with
  a 2-3-line tutorial paragraph; expert mode is silent.
- **Use-case integration:** the curated quickstart-template list is
  available as Step 2 of the full flow, seeding sensible defaults for
  later steps without locking anything down. Use-case keys mirror
  `forgelm/quickstart.py::TEMPLATES` exactly; `quickstart.py` is the
  single source of truth.
- **Pre-flight checklist:** GPU / VRAM / dataset / risk-tier signals
  surface before the configuration summary, calling out common
  operator errors (low-VRAM full-precision, missing local file, strict
  tier without safety eval).
- **Distinct exit code for wizard cancel:** new
  `EXIT_WIZARD_CANCELLED = 5`. Clean cancels exit `5` instead of `0`
  so CI can distinguish "wizard finished" from "wizard never produced
  output". Public exit-code surface is now `0–5`.
- **Best-effort readline:** arrow-key line editing + history on
  Linux/macOS via stdlib `readline` import; Windows unaffected.
- **Validate-on-exit:** the wizard runs `ForgeConfig.model_validate`
  on the saved YAML before declaring success. Schema rejections
  surface inline with the offending field rather than 30 minutes into
  a failed training run.
- **Overwrite confirmation + auto-suffix:** the save flow detects
  pre-existing files, asks before clobbering, and falls back to the
  next free `_2.yaml` / `_3.yaml` slot when declined.
- **Non-tty stdin refusal:** `forgelm --wizard < answers.txt` used to
  silently produce empty configs; the wizard now refuses to launch on
  a non-tty stdin and points the operator at
  `forgelm quickstart <template>` for deterministic scripted
  generation.

#### ISO 27001 / SOC 2 Type II alignment

- **93-control deployer cookbook** at
  [`docs/guides/iso_soc2_deployer_guide.md`](docs/guides/iso_soc2_deployer_guide.md)
  (+ TR mirror) — every ISO 27001:2022 Annex A control and every
  SOC 2 Trust Services Criterion mapped to the ForgeLM feature that
  produces audit evidence. Coverage: FL (full) 11 / FL-helps 48 /
  OOS 34. 10-row Decision Log + 10-question deployer FAQ.
- **4 new QMS docs (EN + TR mirrors):** `encryption_at_rest.md`
  (substrate-side encryption guidance per ForgeLM artefact class),
  `access_control.md` (operator identity contract;
  `FORGELM_OPERATOR` form recommendations; `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET`
  rotation cadence), `risk_treatment_plan.md` (12-row ISO 27005 risk
  register), `statement_of_applicability.md` (93-control SoA matrix).
  Plus expansions of `sop_incident_response.md` (security incidents:
  audit-chain integrity violation, credential leak, supply-chain CVE,
  webhook compromise, GDPR Art. 15/17 DSAR playbooks) and
  `sop_change_management.md` (CI gates as formal change-control
  mechanism).
- **2 new reference tables:** `iso27001_control_mapping.md` (93
  controls × ForgeLM evidence) + `soc2_trust_criteria_mapping.md`
  (each with TR mirror).
- **`README.md`** — new "ISO 27001 / SOC 2 Type II Alignment" bullet
  under Enterprise & MLOps with explicit "alignment, not certified"
  framing.

#### Supply-chain security

- **`pyproject.toml`** — new `[security]` optional extra (`pip-audit`,
  `bandit[toml]`).
- **`tools/check_pip_audit.py`** + **`tools/check_bandit.py`** —
  JSON severity gates; HIGH / CRITICAL → exit 1, MEDIUM →
  `::warning::`, LOW silent.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — `bandit` step on `forgelm/`
  (production code only; tests/ excluded).
- **`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`** — new `supply-chain-security`
  job running `pip-audit` + `bandit` daily at 03:00 UTC.
- **`tools/generate_sbom.py`** — stdlib-only CycloneDX 1.5 emitter;
  called from each `cross-os-tests` matrix combo to produce a
  per-OS-and-Python SBOM artefact.

#### Cross-OS release-tag matrix

- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — tag-driven
  `build → cross-os-tests → publish` chain over 3 OS × 4 Python = 12
  combinations; packaged-wheel install (not editable); SBOM artifact
  upload per combo; OIDC trusted publishing.

#### Pre-commit hooks (optional)

- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** — opt-in local hooks (`ruff`,
  `ruff-format`, `gitleaks`, trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer,
  check-yaml/-toml, check-merge-conflict). CI keeps enforcing the
  same checks; pre-commit is ergonomic optimization, not a duplicate
  enforcement boundary.

#### `forgelm audit --workers N`

- **Split-level parallelism** for the audit pipeline. `--workers N`
  (default 1) runs each split in its own `multiprocessing.Pool`
  worker (spawn-method, pinned in code). Speed-up scales with the
  number of splits — `--workers 3` on a `train` / `validation` /
  `test` corpus typically yields a near-linear speed-up. Single-split
  corpora ignore values >1.
- **Determinism contract pinned by tests.** The merge step that
  builds the final report stays single-threaded so
  `data_audit_report.json` is byte-identical across worker counts
  (only `generated_at` differs as expected — stripped textually
  before SHA-256 comparison).
- **CLI exposure.** `forgelm audit --workers N` registered on the
  audit subparser with a new `_positive_int` argparse type validator
  (rejects 0 / negatives at parse time).

#### Documentation

- **50 new doc files** across guides + reference + usermanuals
  (EN + TR mirrors). Highlights:
  - 11 new reference docs covering every shipped subcommand
    (`verify_audit`, `verify_annex_iv_subcommand`,
    `verify_gguf_subcommand`, `purge_subcommand`,
    `reverse_pii_subcommand`, `approve_subcommand`,
    `approvals_subcommand`, `doctor_subcommand`, `cache_subcommands`,
    `safety_eval_subcommand`, `library_api_reference`).
  - 5 new guides: `getting-started.md` (v0.5.5 onboarding canonical,
    opens with `forgelm doctor`); `air_gap_deployment.md` (deep
    deployer cookbook for `cache-models` / `cache-tasks`);
    `human_approval_gate.md`; `library_api.md`; `performance.md`.
  - 9 new usermanual pages:
    `compliance/{verify-audit, annex-iv, gdpr-erasure, human-approval-gate}`,
    `deployment/verify-gguf`, `operations/{iso-soc2-deployer, supply-chain}`,
    `reference/{library-api, performance}`.
- **Bilingual TR mirror sweep** across `docs/qms/*.md` (10 mirrors)
  and 4 doc pairs brought to structural parity with their EN
  originals.
- **i18n parity:** German / French / Spanish / Chinese now match
  English and Turkish at 731 keys each (was 689). The 168
  previously-untranslated strings cover the regulator-facing surfaces
  (`compliance.gdpr15.*`, `compliance.gdpr17.*`, `compliance.iso.*`,
  `features.gov.*`, `features.eval.safetyeval.*`, `features.ent.*`).
- **`docs/reference/audit_event_catalog.md` (+ TR mirror)** —
  comprehensive event vocabulary with payload schemas.
- **`docs/standards/release.md`** — "Deprecation cadence" section.

#### Doc CI guards

- **`tools/check_bilingual_parity.py --strict`** — replaces the
  inline H2-only check in `ci.yml` with extended H2 + H3 + H4
  structural diff. Detects missing sections, depth changes, reorders.
  Pair registry now 40.
- **`tools/check_anchor_resolution.py --strict`** — markdown link
  resolution guard; baseline cleanup brought broken anchors from
  36 → 0.
- **`tools/check_cli_help_consistency.py --strict`** — discovers the
  live parser surface by spawning `forgelm <subcommand> --help` for
  every shipped subcommand; walks docs / README for fenced
  bash/shell `forgelm` invocations; reports drift classes
  (subcommand not in parser; flag not in parser; flag value not in
  parser's `choices` list).
- **`tools/check_field_descriptions.py --strict`** — AST-based
  scanner of Pydantic `BaseModel` subclasses; exits 1 on any field
  missing a `description=`.
- **`tools/check_no_analysis_refs.py`** — prohibits citations to
  gitignored working-memory directories from the public tree.
- **`tools/check_wizard_defaults_sync.py`** — fails CI on schema-vs-
  shipped-JSON drift for the wizard's source-of-truth defaults.

#### HTTP discipline

- **`forgelm/_http.safe_get(url, *, headers, timeout, ..., method="GET"|"HEAD")`** —
  disciplined outbound GET / HEAD mirroring `safe_post`'s policy
  contract (scheme allowlist, SSRF guard, timeout floor, redirect
  refusal, secret-mask error path, TLS verify). Used by
  `forgelm doctor` and any future probe / telemetry / registry ping
  that needs an outbound read.
- **`forgelm/_http.safe_post`** — single boundary
  for outbound HTTP with SSRF guard, redirect refusal, scheme policy,
  timeout floor, TLS pinning, secret-mask error reasons. Migrated
  webhook + judge + synthetic call sites.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** `lint-http-discipline` step greps
  `forgelm/` for `requests.*(...)`, `urllib.request.urlopen(...)`,
  `httpx.*(...)` outside `forgelm/_http.py` and fails on any hit.

#### Article 14 staging directory

- When `evaluation.require_human_approval=true`, the trainer now
  saves the final adapters to `final_model.staging/` instead of
  writing to `final_model/` before review. The
  `human_approval.required` audit event payload now also carries
  `staging_path` and `run_id` so downstream tooling can cross-check
  the approval against the originating run.
- **`evaluation.staging_ttl_days`** config field documents the
  retention horizon for `final_model.staging/` after a
  `forgelm reject`; default 7 days. Auto-deletion enforcement is
  delegated to `forgelm purge` (GDPR right-to-erasure tooling).

#### New audit events

- **Erasure family (six events):** `data.erasure_requested`,
  `data.erasure_completed`, `data.erasure_failed`, plus three
  operator-warning events.
- **Access-request family:** `data.access_request_query`
  (Article 15) — identifier salted-and-hashed before emission.
- **Cache-population family (six events):** `cache.populate_*`.
- **Approval family:** `human_approval.required`,
  `human_approval.granted`, `human_approval.rejected`,
  `approval.required`.
- **Training lifecycle:** `training.reverted` paired with
  `WebhookNotifier.notify_reverted`.
- **Operator-error family:** `audit.classifier_load_failed`,
  `cli.legacy_flag_invoked`.

#### Other additions

- **`SafetyEvalThresholds` dataclass** bundles five Phase 9 knobs so
  `run_safety_evaluation` stays under the 13-param ceiling.
- **`tests/test_lazy_imports.py`** — regression test pinning that
  `import forgelm.trainer` / `import forgelm.model` do not eagerly
  load torch.

### Changed

- **`forgelm/cli.py` → `forgelm/cli/` package.** The ~2300-line
  monolith was split into a 24-module package (`subcommands/`,
  `_dispatch`, `_training`, `_dry_run`, `_result`, `_resume`,
  `_logging`, `_exit_codes`, etc.). The `forgelm.cli:main` entry
  point and `python -m forgelm.cli` are preserved; dispatcher uses
  late-binding facade re-resolution so test monkeypatches
  (`forgelm.cli._run_chat_cmd` etc.) keep resolving correctly.
- **`forgelm/data_audit.py` → `forgelm/data_audit/` package.** The
  3098-line monolith was split into a 14-module package (`_optional`,
  `_types`, `_pii_regex`, `_pii_ml`, `_secrets`, `_simhash`,
  `_minhash`, `_quality`, `_streaming`, `_aggregator`, `_splits`,
  `_summary`, `_croissant`, `_orchestrator`). The public
  `forgelm.data_audit.X` import surface — including the
  test-touched private helpers — is preserved by `__init__.py`
  re-exports so external callers and the test suite keep working
  without code changes.
- **Pydantic `description=` migration** — every Pydantic field across
  the config schema (19 model classes) migrated to
  `Field(default=..., description=...)` form. Operator-facing copy
  pulled from existing inline comments + variable semantics; the
  configuration reference can now be auto-generated from the schema
  in lockstep with the code.
- **Site copy now matches the live code surface.** Sweep across
  `site/*.html` and `site/js/translations.js` correcting drift that
  had accumulated against the production code:
  - **YAML demo accuracy:** the homepage hero YAML demo and the
    quickstart `verify-audit` example now use real Pydantic field
    names and accept paths that pass the live CLI check; copying any
    visible snippet and running `forgelm --config <copy> --dry-run`
    works as advertised.
  - **Compliance artefact tree:** the EU AI Act / ISO 27001 page
    redrawn against the actual on-disk layout — `compliance/`
    sub-tree (was `artifacts/`), `audit_log.jsonl` at the checkpoint
    root, `final_model/` carrying the model card + deployer
    instructions + integrity manifest. Removed phantom
    `config_snapshot.yaml` row (no code path emits it).
  - **Ghost YAML keys removed:** `compliance.config_hash` and
    `compliance.human_approval` (which `ComplianceMetadataConfig`'s
    `extra="forbid"` rejected) replaced with the canonical
    `evaluation.require_human_approval` and a description of
    `forgelm verify-audit` chain integrity.
  - **Ghost CLI flag removed:** `--model-card` no longer mentioned
    on the Article 13 evidence cell; the model card is auto-generated
    on every successful run.
  - **Stale namespace + symbol-list corrected:** Library API
    references now use `from forgelm import …` with real symbols from
    `forgelm.__all__` (`ForgeTrainer`, `audit_dataset`,
    `verify_audit_log`, `verify_annex_iv_artifact`, `mask_pii`).
  - **Wording aligned with live behaviour:** auto-revert (deletes
    artefacts + exits with `EXIT_EVAL_FAILURE = 3`, not "rolls back
    to last-good checkpoint"), exit codes (`0–5`, was `0/1/2/3/4`),
    Annex IV "nine §1-9 sections" (was "eight"),
    `forgelm safety-eval` accepted formats (`--probes` JSONL or
    `--default-probes`; outputs `safety_results.json` +
    `safety_trend.jsonl`), `forgelm verify-annex-iv` claim narrowed
    to schema completeness + `manifest_hash` (audit-chain integrity
    is the separate `verify-audit` command), `forgelm purge`
    documented as emitting `data.erasure_requested` +
    `data.erasure_completed` audit events.
  - **Wizard preset divergence:** the in-browser `USE_CASE_PRESETS`
    is now byte-equivalent to `forgelm/quickstart.py::TEMPLATES`.
    Operators who finish the wizard see the same model IDs and
    bundled-dataset paths the CLI `quickstart` would have set.
  - **JSON-LD `operatingSystem`:** all 8 pages updated from
    `"Linux, macOS"` to `"Linux, macOS, Windows"`, matching the
    README's tri-platform pitch and the PyPI
    `Operating System :: OS Independent` classifier.
  - **Mermaid disclosure:** the privacy page now lists three
    third-party requests (Google Fonts, jsDelivr / Mermaid on the
    Guide page only, Formspree on contact-form submit) in all six
    locales.
  - **Audit-event scope:** Article 12 description widened from
    "training start, eval gates, auto-revert decisions" to the real
    vocabulary (training start/end, eval gates, auto-revert
    decisions, human-approval gates, GDPR Article 17 erasure,
    Article 15 access-request queries, model export) with HMAC +
    SHA-256 chain language replacing the per-artefact SHA-256
    wording.
- **Working-memory directories cleanup.** Operator-local research,
  audit drafts, and external-repo comparisons now live in
  working-memory directories that are strictly gitignored with no
  exceptions and never appear in fresh clones. The previous
  re-include carve-outs that exposed individual files were dropped,
  the working-memory tree was untracked at the directory level, and
  every public-tree citation pointing into it was rewritten or
  removed. The rule is now codified in
  `docs/standards/documentation.md` ("Working-memory directories"),
  enforced by a new CI guard (`tools/check_no_analysis_refs.py`)
  wired into the self-review chain in `CLAUDE.md`. False positives
  (functional path filters in production code) are handled via an
  `_EXEMPT` allowlist with per-entry justification comments.
- **Minimum required `torch` bumped from 2.1.0 to 2.3.0.**
  `torch.distributed.fsdp.FSDPModule` (introduced in torch 2.3) is
  referenced by `tests/test_grpo_reward.py` and runtime GRPO paths.
- **16 broad `except Exception` sites narrowed** across
  `_streaming.py`, `trainer.py`, `safety.py`, `judge.py`,
  `compliance.py`, `ingestion.py` to specific exception classes;
  7 sites retained with `# noqa: BLE001` and rationale comments per
  `docs/standards/error-handling.md` carve-out. MoE expert-name
  resolver migrated from hardcoded substring match to regex-registry
  (`_EXPERT_NAME_PATTERNS`) covering Mixtral, Qwen 3 MoE,
  DeepSeek-V3, Phi-MoE.
- **6 enum-shaped config fields tightened to `Literal[...]`** —
  `LoraConfig.bias`, `DistributedConfig.fsdp_backward_prefetch` /
  `fsdp_state_dict_type`, `SafetyConfig.scoring`,
  `ComplianceMetadataConfig.risk_classification`,
  `TrainingConfig.galore_optim` / `galore_proj_type`. Pydantic now
  validates whitelist at parse time; bespoke runtime validators
  removed.
- **`AuditLogger`** — operator identity raises `ConfigError` instead
  of falling back to literal `"unknown"`.
  `getpass.getuser()@socket.gethostname()` chain with
  `FORGELM_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_OPERATOR=1` escape hatch.
- **`AuditLogger.log_event`** — `os.fsync(f.fileno())` after flush;
  chain durability across power-cut.
- **`compute_dataset_fingerprint`** split into three helpers (local
  file / HF metadata / HF revision); HF Hub revision SHA pinned.
- **Safety eval batched with token-pad-longest + per-batch CUDA-OOM
  fallback** — `_generate_safety_responses` and
  `_generate_responses_batched` use `batch_size=8` default with
  single-prompt fallback on OOM. Per-batch error handling extracted
  to `_generate_*_batch_with_oom_retry` helpers.
- **`_chunk_paragraph_tokens`** — single-encode + offset slicing
  (performance fix).
- **`_post_payload`** — delegates to `safe_post` with
  `min_timeout=1.0` for back-compat.
- **7 notebooks** install from PyPI (`forgelm[qlora]==0.5.5`) instead
  of `git+https://...`.
- **CI** enforces `pytest --cov-fail-under=40` via `pyproject.toml`
  `addopts`. Matrix `fail-fast: false`; `usermanuals-validate.yml`
  runs on push + PR.
- **Site honesty:** `compliance.html` artefact tree, `quickstart.html`
  template names, GPU stat (16 vs claimed 18) — all refreshed against
  real code.
- **QMS `sop_data_management.md`** — single v0.5.0 story; v0.5.1+ /
  v0.5.2 splits removed.
- **Roadmap** (`roadmap.md`, `roadmap-tr.md`, `releases.md`) — v0.5.5
  marked released; tristate status legend added.
- **Webhook config persisted into compliance manifest.**
  `generate_training_manifest` now writes `webhook_config` into
  `<output_dir>/compliance/compliance_report.json` so `forgelm
  approve` / `forgelm reject` (which run with no `--config` flag)
  can rebuild the notifier and fire the success / rejection webhook.
  Operator secrets resolve from env at runtime via `url_env` /
  `secret_env` so persisting the config shape is safe.
- **`forgelm.webhook`** exports `_is_private_destination` via
  `__all__` for back-compat (helper moved to `forgelm._http`).
- **Standards updates** — `architecture.md` reflects the package
  splits; `documentation.md` cites the new CI guards;
  `localization.md` formalises EN + TR mandatory + DE / FR / ES / ZH
  deferred; `release.md` documents the v0.5.5 release sequence;
  `testing.md` test count refreshed.

### Fixed

- **Nightly pip-audit gate — `transformers` CVE-2026-1839**
  (issue [#37](https://github.com/cemililik/ForgeLM/issues/37)). The
  Supply-chain security workflow flagged the CVE whose published fix
  lives in `transformers 5.0.0rc3` (release candidate). ForgeLM's
  `pyproject.toml` pins `transformers>=4.38.0,<5.0.0`; the 5.x branch
  is a major version bump that breaks downstream callers (TRL adapter
  signature changes + tokenizer-config API drift), and there is no
  4.x backport available at the time of writing. Stop-gap: an
  explicit `--ignore-vuln CVE-2026-1839` in
  `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` with documented rationale and a
  remove-after condition (revisit at every release; remove the ignore
  once `transformers` ships a 4.x point release with the fix or
  ForgeLM cuts a tracked major-version-bump cycle).
- **Wizard YAML output is now `safe_dump(allow_unicode=True)` with
  explicit UTF-8 file handles** — prevents `!!python/object` tags
  from leaking into generated YAML when a collector returns a Path
  or set, and stops mojibake on non-ASCII compliance fields.
- **Wizard hardware-detection cache.** `_detect_hardware()` runs once
  per session; the welcome step and the post-save pre-flight
  checklist share the result instead of paying a second torch import
  + CUDA enumeration (~50–200 ms saved).
- **Wizard back / reset semantics.** `WizardBack` restores
  `state.config` from a `copy.deepcopy` snapshot taken before the
  step ran (partial mutations no longer leak into the previous
  step's prompts). `WizardReset` re-loops with a fresh state instead
  of treating the reset as a completed run and trying to save an
  empty config.
- **Wizard BYOD path validation.** Typed dataset values are now
  checked as a directory of ingestible docs, a JSONL/JSON file, or
  an HF Hub ID before being accepted; bare typos no longer silently
  become `data.dataset_name_or_path`.
- **Wizard non-empty re-prompt for Article 9 / Article 10 free-text
  fields** (`intended_use`, `foreseeable_misuse`,
  `mitigation_measures`, `collection_method`, `annotation_process`,
  `known_biases`). Empty values used to slip through and surface as
  Pydantic `ConfigError` at training-time load.
- **CUDA capability check.** `torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem`
  → `total_memory` in `_detect_hardware` (the previous attribute
  doesn't exist; welcome step crashed on real CUDA hosts).
- **Wizard cross-tab sync.** The web wizard listens for `storage`
  events and reloads state when a sibling tab edits the same wizard,
  eliminating the "last write wins" race.
- **Wizard bundled safety-probes resolution.** The wizard's default
  safety probe set is now resolved through
  `importlib.resources.files("forgelm.safety_prompts")`, fixing the
  `pip install forgelm` regression where
  `configs/safety_prompts/general_safety.jsonl` was the wizard
  default but never shipped in the wheel.
- **`forgelm.compliance.verify_audit_log`** as a public function —
  closes a critical gap where the chain integrity check existed but
  had no library entry point.
- **Audit event catalog and CLI sample drift fixed** — placeholder
  `<TBD>` entries in `audit_event_catalog.md` filled;
  trailing-whitespace cleaned; CLI help sample in
  `docs/reference/usage.md` brought in sync with current subcommand
  surface.
- **Tier 1 ghost-feature drift:**
  - `verify-log` → `verify-audit` rename in user manuals.
  - `forgelm chat` slash commands aligned with parser: removed
    `/load`, `/top_p`, `/max_tokens`, `/safety on|off`;
    `/quit` → `/exit`.
  - `q6_k` quant level removed from GGUF docs (parser only supports
    `q2_k|q3_k_m|q4_k_m|q5_k_m|q8_0|f16`); `f16` row added.
  - `FORGELM_RESUME_TOKEN` env var removed from manuals; replaced
    with the canonical CLI subcommand flow (`forgelm approve` /
    `reject` + `forgelm approvals --pending`).
  - `FORGELM_CACHE_DIR` env var removed; `HF_HOME` declared
    canonical.
  - `forgelm benchmark --model "..."` (subcommand form that doesn't
    exist) → `forgelm --config <yaml> --benchmark-only <path>` (the
    shipped flag form).
  - `--export-bundle` → `--compliance-export` rename.
  - `kserve` / `triton` rows removed from deploy targets (parser
    only ships `{ollama,vllm,tgi,hf-endpoints}`).
  - Ingest flag drift: `--max-tokens` → `--chunk-tokens`; removed
    non-existent `--language` / `--include` / `--exclude` /
    `--format` / `--pii-locale` flags; `--strategy` choices clarified
    to `{sliding,paragraph,markdown}`.
- **Documentation and CI guard plumbing:** `docs/design/wizard_mode.md`
  rewritten to describe the actual 9-step flow;
  `docs/reference/architecture{,-tr}.md` heading updated from
  `wizard.py` to `wizard/` to match the sub-package layout;
  `docs/usermanuals/{en,tr}/compliance/human-approval-gate.md`
  cross-references exit code 5 alongside the existing exit-4
  discussion.

### Deprecated

- **`forgelm --data-audit PATH`** — the legacy flag now emits a
  `DeprecationWarning` and an `cli.legacy_flag_invoked` audit-log
  event on every invocation. Behaviour is unchanged; the flag is
  scheduled for removal in **v0.7.0**. Migrate to the
  `forgelm audit PATH` subcommand (same output, same exit codes).
  See [docs/standards/release.md](docs/standards/release.md#deprecation-cadence)
  for the removal timeline.
- **`evaluation.staging_ttl_days`** alias-forwards to
  `retention.staging_ttl_days` with a single `DeprecationWarning`;
  conflicting values raise `ConfigError`. Removal scheduled for
  v0.7.0.

### Removed

- **`[ingestion-secrets]` extra (`detect-secrets>=1.5.0,<2.0.0`)** —
  reserved during Phase 12 for a follow-up integration that never
  landed. The `detect-secrets` scanner expects file paths while
  ForgeLM audits row-level JSONL streams, so the wire-up was rejected
  as architecturally incompatible. The prefix-anchored regex set in
  `forgelm/data_audit/_secrets.py` (9-family coverage: AWS, GitHub,
  Slack, OpenAI, Google API, JWT, OpenSSH, PGP, Azure storage) is
  the sole detection backend and stays the sole detection backend.
  Removed the dead extra from `pyproject.toml`, the install snippet
  from `README.md`, and the "fallback regex set" framing from the
  secrets module docstring.

### Breaking changes (deliberate)

- **High-risk + safety-disabled now raises `ConfigError`.**
  `risk_classification ∈ {high-risk, unacceptable}` combined with
  `evaluation.safety.enabled=false` now raises at config-load time
  (was a warning). EU AI Act Article 9 risk-management evidence
  cannot be derived from a disabled safety eval. Operators with
  sandboxed runs must lower the `risk_classification` or enable
  safety.
- **`WebhookConfig.timeout` default raised 5s → 10s.** Slack/Teams
  gateway latency spikes regularly cross 5s; webhook failure is
  best-effort but a timeout silently degrades the audit chain.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-30

**Theme:** "Document Ingestion + Data Curation Pipeline" — Phases 11,
11.5, 12, and 12.5 ship as one comprehensive release.

> **Note on consolidation.** Originally planned as four sequential
> PyPI tags (`v0.5.0` / `v0.5.1` / `v0.5.2` / `v0.5.3`) but consolidated
> into a single `v0.5.0` because the four phases form one coherent
> surface (ingest → polish → mature → polish) that's hard to use in
> parts. Git history retains the four phases as separate commit
> batches; this entry collapses them into the user-facing release
> notes. Section markers below preserve the phase boundary so
> reviewers can map back to [docs/roadmap/releases.md](docs/roadmap/releases.md).

The release adds:

- **Phase 11** — `forgelm ingest` (PDF / DOCX / EPUB / TXT / Markdown
  → SFT-ready JSONL) + `forgelm audit` (length / language /
  near-duplicate / cross-split leakage / PII) + EU AI Act Article 10
  governance integration.
- **Phase 11.5** — operational polish on the Phase 11 surface: LSH
  banding, streaming reader, token-aware chunking, PDF
  header/footer dedup, PII severity tiers, atomic audit writes.
- **Phase 12** — data curation maturity: MinHash LSH dedup option,
  markdown-aware splitter, code/secrets leakage tagger, heuristic
  quality filter, DOCX table preservation.
- **Phase 12.5** — small additive polish: `--all-mask` shorthand,
  Croissant 1.0 dataset card emission, optional Presidio ML-NER PII
  adapter, wizard "audit first" entry point.

CI / docs / standards bookkeeping accompanying every phase is folded
into "Cross-cutting review hardening" at the bottom (rounds 1–12 of
review-cycle fixes applied across the four phases above).

---

### Phase 12.5 — Data Curation Polish (backlog items #1–#4)

Four follow-up items from
[`docs/roadmap/completed-phases.md`](docs/roadmap/completed-phases.md)
ship together — none require new architecture; each is a small
additive surface on top of the Phase 12 ingestion + audit lineage.

- **`forgelm ingest --all-mask`** (item #3) — one-flag shorthand for
  `--secrets-mask --pii-mask` in the documented mask order (secrets
  first so combined detectors don't double-count overlapping spans).
  Composes additively with explicit flags (set-union, no error). Pure
  UX; no new behaviour.
- **`forgelm audit --croissant`** (item #2) — opt-in
  [Google Croissant 1.0](http://mlcommons.org/croissant/) dataset card
  emitted under a new `croissant` key in `data_audit_report.json`. The
  card carries dataset-level identity, one `cr:FileObject` per JSONL
  split, and a `cr:RecordSet` per split with `cr:Field` entries
  derived from the audit's column detection. Existing audit JSON keys
  are byte-equivalent — the block stays empty when the flag is off
  (same precedent as `secrets_summary` / `quality_summary`). Lets the
  same JSON file double as both the EU AI Act Article 10 governance
  artifact and a Croissant-consumer dataset card.
  - `url` and `contentUrl` use the as-typed input string and the
    relative split filename, never the resolved absolute filesystem
    path, so cards published to HuggingFace / MLCommons don't leak
    the auditor's local layout.
  - Croissant `version` (`sc:version`, dataset version) is omitted
    deliberately — the audit doesn't have first-class evidence for
    it; vocab conformance is declared via `conformsTo`. Operators
    that publish hand-edit `version` like they do `license` /
    `citeAs`.
  - The card is now also surfaced in the `--output-format json`
    stdout envelope alongside the on-disk report so CI consumers
    don't need a second file slurp.
- **`forgelm audit --pii-ml [--pii-ml-language LANG]`** + new
  `[ingestion-pii-ml]` extra (item #1) — opt-in
  [Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio) ML-NER PII detector
  layered on top of the existing regex detector. Adds the
  unstructured-identifier categories the regex inherently misses
  (`person`, `organization`, `location`) into the same `pii_summary` /
  `pii_severity` blocks under disjoint category names. Severity tiers
  in the new `PII_ML_SEVERITY` table: `person → medium`,
  `organization → low`, `location → low` (deliberately below the regex
  `critical`/`high` tiers because NER false-positive rates are
  materially higher than regex-anchored detection). The pre-flight
  check covers BOTH the missing-extra branch AND the missing-spaCy-model
  branch — `presidio-analyzer` does *not* transitively ship a spaCy
  NER model, so the install recipe is now two lines:
  ```bash
  pip install 'forgelm[ingestion-pii-ml]'
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
  ```
  Without either, `forgelm audit --pii-ml` raises `ImportError` with
  the recipe before any rows are scanned. Per-row Presidio failures
  are scoped to `(ValueError, RuntimeError)` so a single malformed row
  never blocks the audit, but a deep `OSError` from a missing model
  surfaces loudly instead of silently scoring zero ML coverage.
  `--pii-ml-language` (default `"en"`) lets non-English corpora point
  at the matching spaCy model; Presidio raises a typed exception when
  no engine is registered for the requested language.
- **Wizard "audit first" entry point** (item #4) — when the wizard
  resolves a JSONL (either typed directly or produced by the
  Phase 11.5 `_offer_ingest_for_directory` ingest flow), it now offers
  to run `forgelm audit` on it inline and prints `summarize_report`'s
  verdict before continuing. Mirrors the
  `_offer_ingest_for_directory` shape exactly. Closes the BYOD audit
  loop end-to-end. Audit is informational, not a gate — failures fall
  through to the "continue without audit" path.

Touch points (so the next reviewer can audit blast radius quickly):

- `forgelm/ingestion.py` — no module changes (the flag composes at the
  CLI boundary into the existing `pii_mask` / `secrets_mask` booleans).
- `forgelm/cli.py` — three new flags on the existing subparsers
  (`--all-mask` on `forgelm ingest`; `--croissant` and `--pii-ml` on
  `forgelm audit`); dispatcher signatures threaded through.
- `forgelm/data_audit.py` — `_HAS_PRESIDIO` sentinel, `_require_presidio`,
  `_get_presidio_analyzer` (cached), `detect_pii_ml`,
  `PII_ML_SEVERITY`, `PII_ML_TYPES`, `_PRESIDIO_ENTITY_MAP`,
  `_build_croissant_metadata`, `_CROISSANT_CONTEXT`. New
  `enable_pii_ml` / `emit_croissant` parameters on `audit_dataset` /
  `_process_split` / `_audit_split`; new `enable_pii_ml` field on
  `_StreamingAggregator`; new `croissant` field on `AuditReport`.
  `_build_pii_severity` now consults the merged
  `PII_SEVERITY ∪ PII_ML_SEVERITY` table.
- `forgelm/wizard.py` — new `_offer_audit_for_jsonl(path)` helper;
  invoked from `_offer_ingest_for_directory` (after ingest produces
  a JSONL), `_validate_local_jsonl` (after a directly-provided JSONL
  passes validation), and `_prompt_dataset_path_with_ingest_offer`
  (after a non-directory JSONL is provided to the full wizard).
- `pyproject.toml` — new `[ingestion-pii-ml]` extra
  (`presidio-analyzer>=2.2.0,<3.0.0`).
- `tests/test_phase12_5.py` — 11 new tests, four classes (one per
  backlog row).
- `tests/test_wizard_byod.py` — three existing tests get an extra
  `"n"` answer to decline the new audit-first offer (the offer
  behaviour has its own coverage in `test_phase12_5.py`).
- Docs — `README.md` install matrix + Phase 12.5 feature line;
  `docs/standards/architecture.md` extras matrix; `docs/guides/ingestion{,-tr}.md`
  + `docs/guides/data_audit{,-tr}.md` get dedicated sections per
  feature; `notebooks/data_curation.ipynb` mentions `--all-mask` and
  the Phase 12.5 audit add-ons inline.

### Fixed — post-PR-#13 review-cycle batches (rounds 8-12)

Inline-comment batches landing on top of PR #13 (now merged to `main`).
Same review surface as rounds 4-7; further hardening on top of the
`v0.5.2` content.

- **Audit log hardening** (`forgelm/compliance.py`) — HMAC `_hmac` field is now
  emitted only when `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET` is set; without a secret, a key
  derived solely from the public `run_id` would be forgeable, so we no longer
  claim tamper-evidence we cannot deliver. `log_event` re-reads the chain head
  from disk under the same `flock` so two writers sharing the same log can no
  longer fork the chain. `_read_chain_head` refuses to derive a head from a
  tail that does not end with `\n` (truncated last record). The oversize-
  final-entry case is recovered by re-reading from `seek_start` without
  skipping the partial first line.
- **Deployer-instructions Markdown injection** (`forgelm/compliance.py::generate_deployer_instructions`) —
  config-derived strings (`system_name`, `model.name_or_path`, fine-tuning
  method, model location, foreseeable-misuse bullets, metric names) now go
  through `_sanitize_md` before template substitution; pipes / backticks /
  link syntax in any of those can no longer break out of table cells or
  bullets in the generated Article 13 document.
- **Quality-filter denominator** (`forgelm/data_audit.py::_build_quality_summary`) —
  `overall_quality_score` now divides by the number of rows the filter
  actually evaluated (text-bearing dict rows) instead of `total_samples`.
  A corpus that's 50 % null but 100 % clean on the rest now reads `1.0`
  instead of `0.5`.
- **NumPy-fast-path bits guard** (`forgelm/data_audit.py::compute_simhash`) —
  the `_compute_simhash_numpy` dispatch now also gates on `bits <= 64`;
  without it, `np.uint64` would silently truncate digests wider than 64
  bits.
- **Sliding-overlap clamp** (`forgelm/ingestion.py::ingest_path`) — when
  `--overlap` is not passed and the strategy is `sliding`, the implicit
  `DEFAULT_SLIDING_OVERLAP` (200) is now clamped to `chunk_size // 2`. A
  small `--chunk-size 300` used to trip `_chunk_sliding`'s
  "overlap > chunk_size // 2" guard with the default overlap — surfacing
  as a confusing error for a knob the user did not set.
- **Batch-tokenizer narrow except** (`forgelm/ingestion.py::_count_section_tokens`) —
  the bare `except Exception` around the batched `tokenizer(blocks)` call
  is now narrowed to `(TypeError, ValueError)` (the documented
  unsupported-batch signal); the returned `BatchEncoding` is shape-
  validated before its `input_ids` is consumed. Real bugs (corrupted
  input, OOM, etc.) no longer mask behind the slow per-block fallback.
- **Webhook secret-fallback safety** (`forgelm/webhook.py`) —
  `requests.post` now passes `allow_redirects=False` (an SSRF-pre-validated
  URL cannot be redirected to a private destination) and the
  `mask_secrets` `ImportError` fallback emits `[REDACTED — secrets
  masker unavailable]` instead of the raw 512-char reason prefix.
  See [#14](https://github.com/cemililik/ForgeLM/issues/14) for the
  remaining DNS-rebinding TOCTOU follow-up tracked for `v0.5.3`.
- **Trainer governance failure visibility** (`forgelm/trainer.py`) — the
  `data_governance_report.json` export try/except now catches the full
  `Exception` set (was `OSError` only) so non-IO failures (`TypeError`,
  `ValueError`, `AttributeError`) still surface as
  `compliance.governance_failed` audit events instead of crashing the
  surrounding compliance flow. The rollup `compliance.artifacts_exported`
  event is gated on a `governance_ok` flag so the audit chain truthfully
  reflects which artefacts are actually on disk.
- **Compliance manifest exception narrowing** (`forgelm/compliance.py`) —
  the broad `except Exception` around the HF Hub `load_dataset_builder`
  fingerprint fetch is now a tuple of realistic failure modes
  (`ImportError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `AttributeError`,
  `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`).
- **Strict messages-format validation** (`forgelm/data.py`) —
  `_process_messages_format` now explicitly checks `isinstance(role, str)`
  and `isinstance(content, str)` before formatting; non-string content
  (dicts, ints) used to be silently coerced via f-string `__format__`
  and slip through into training.
- **Wizard ASCII regex flag** (`forgelm/wizard.py`) — `_HF_HUB_ID_RE`
  now compiles with `re.ASCII` so the `\w` class means
  `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. HF Hub IDs are ASCII-only, and Unicode-aware `\w`
  would otherwise accept characters the Hub itself rejects.
- **GGUF converter case-insensitive validation** (`forgelm/export.py`) —
  the `FORGELM_GGUF_CONVERTER` `.py` suffix check now uses
  `casefold()` (cross-platform: HFS+/NTFS), and `export_model()`'s
  catch widened from `(ImportError, FileNotFoundError)` to also
  include `ValueError` so a non-`.py` env override produces an
  `ExportResult` instead of crashing the caller.
- **Markdown chunker complexity refactor** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`) —
  `_chunk_markdown_tokens` split into `_build_markdown_section_blocks`
  (render breadcrumb + body), `_count_section_tokens` (batch tokenizer
  call with per-block fallback), and the main chunker (greedy packing).
  Cognitive complexity drops from 16 → ~8.
- **Bidirectional MinHash extraction** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — the
  two near-identical `a→lsh_b` / `b→lsh_a` query loops in
  `_count_leaked_rows_minhash_bidirectional` were extracted into one
  `_count_leaks_against_index` helper. Complexity drops from 24 → ~5;
  the SonarCloud duplication metric on this file goes away.
- **Streaming length digest** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — the per-split
  text-length distribution is now accumulated via a bounded
  `_LengthDigest` (Algorithm R reservoir, 100K cap) instead of an
  unbounded `List[int]`. Audit memory on multi-million-row splits is
  now O(1) instead of O(n).
- **Documentation drift sweep (round N)** — five compliance-summary
  links repointed to `../../forgelm/...`, two missing FSDP knobs
  (`fsdp_backward_prefetch`, `fsdp_state_dict_type`) and two webhook
  knobs (`allow_private_destinations`, `tls_ca_bundle`) added to both
  EN and TR `configuration` reference; Pro CLI section added to
  `README.md`; CI now runs a bilingual H2 parity check across seven
  EN/TR doc pairs (`configuration`, `usage`, `distributed_training`,
  `data_preparation`, `architecture`, `ingestion`, `data_audit`); test
  count refreshed to 47 in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to match
  `architecture.md`; secrets list aligned to the full nine families
  in `forgelm.data_audit.SECRET_TYPES` (was missing two private-key
  splits + Azure storage in some prose).
- **Phase 12 fenced log block** in both `usage.md` and `usage-tr.md`
  now uses ```` ```text ```` so markdownlint MD040 stops flagging it.

### Fixed — multi-agent master review (rounds 4-7)

Multi-dimension review (business, code, compliance, documentation, performance, security) surfaced a cluster of correctness, claim/evidence, and silent-failure issues that have been swept in batches.

- **Version drift** — `forgelm.__version__` was hard-coded to `0.5.0rc1` in [`forgelm/__init__.py`](forgelm/__init__.py) while `pyproject.toml` declared `0.5.2rc1`. The literal is now derived from the installed distribution via `importlib.metadata.version("forgelm")` (with a `0.0.0+dev` fallback for raw source checkouts), and `compliance._get_version()` follows the same resolution path so audit / Annex IV manifests stamp the correct producer version.
- **Audit log integrity** (`forgelm/compliance.py::AuditLogger`) — `_load_last_hash` previously re-rooted the chain to `"genesis"` on any read failure with only a `logger.debug` message; `log_event` advanced `_prev_hash` *before* the file write and swallowed write failures with `logger.warning`. Both paths now distinguish file-missing from file-unreadable, raise on real I/O errors, and only advance the hash chain after a successful write.
- **`compute_dataset_fingerprint` TOCTOU** — `@lru_cache(maxsize=32)` keyed on the path string only would return stale fingerprints when the file was rewritten in place. Cache dropped; symlinks resolved before hashing; `os.stat()` now captured atomically alongside the SHA-256 stream so size/mtime cannot drift between the two reads.
- **`generate_data_governance_report` wiring** — defined and tested but never called from production code. Now invoked by `_export_compliance_if_needed` so `data_governance_report.json` actually lands in the trainer's `output_dir` per EU AI Act Article 10.
- **Silent-failure sweep** — replaced `except Exception:` swallows with concrete-class catches + log + raise/sentinel: `data.py::_process_messages_format` (catches malformed message rows by exception class, raises an explicit `ValueError`), `safety.py::_release_model_from_gpu` (`RuntimeError`/`OOM` only), `cli.py::_load_config_or_exit` (split `yaml.YAMLError` + `pydantic.ValidationError` for clearer error messages), `config.py::ForgeConfig.load_config` (specific Pydantic / YAML branches).
- **Pydantic schema discipline** — six bare-`str` fields (`trainer_type`, `merge.method`, `model.backend`, `distributed.fsdp_strategy`, `risk_assessment.risk_category`, `monitoring.metrics_export`) converted to `Literal[...]` so JSON Schema / IDE auto-complete surfaces the allowed values; redundant runtime validators dropped.
- **Webhook hardening** — `forgelm/webhook.py` now refuses non-loopback private destinations without explicit opt-in (`webhook.allow_private_destinations`), runs the failure-reason payload through `mask_secrets`, passes `verify=True` explicitly to `requests.post`, and rejects `timeout < 1`.
- **Performance** — `forgelm/trainer.py` lazy-imports `torch` / `transformers` / `trl` into method bodies, dropping CLI cold-start cost by ~700-1500 ms on `forgelm audit` and `forgelm --help`. Audit's `agg.minhashes` is no longer copied via `list(...)` before LSH (saves ~1 GB on 1M-row splits).
- **Documentation** — refreshed module / test / notebook counts in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/reference/architecture.md`; added `forgelm/templates/` to the directory layout. Removed `forgelm chat --safety` from `usage.md` (flag does not exist in `cli.py`). `coverage.fail_under` in `docs/standards/testing.md` now matches `pyproject.toml` (40, not 25).

### Fixed — round 3.5 review (`_MARKDOWN_CODE_FENCE` regex → non-regex parser)

SonarCloud `python:S5852` flagged `_MARKDOWN_CODE_FENCE` (`forgelm/ingestion.py` L515) — the regex `^ {0,3}(?P<fence>` `` ` ``{3,}|~{3,})(?P<rest>[^\n]*)$` had **two unbounded greedy quantifiers in sequence over overlapping character classes** (the fence run is `` ` `` / `~`; the `rest` capture's `[^\n]` includes both fence chars), the textbook polynomial-runtime shape per regex.md rule 4.

- Empirically linear in CPython (50K-char pure-backtick run = 16 μs), but the static analyser can't prove that — and we already use non-regex line walkers everywhere else for markdown parsing (regex.md rule 6).
- Replaced with `_parse_md_fence(line)` — a non-regex parser that returns `(fence_char, run_length, rest_after_run)` or `None`. Provably O(n) per line; 100K-char pure-backtick run measures ~10 μs.
- `_markdown_sections` updated to use the helper directly (no behavioural change — the helper returns the same tuple shape the regex's named groups did).
- 2 new regression tests in `tests/test_phase12_review_fixes.py::TestRegexLinearity` — `test_parse_md_fence_linear_on_long_runs` (≤ 100 ms cap on N=100K) + `test_parse_md_fence_behaviour` (pinned outputs for opener with info string, 4-char fence, 2-space indent, 4-space indent → None, sub-3-char run → None, mismatched chars after run).

### Fixed — round 3 review (post-`69ee6ab`)

Round-3 review caught two real correctness bugs (Unicode `\w` in
secret regexes, fence-length rule violation in markdown / code-fence
tracking) plus a handful of doc / fixture parity issues. All applied.

- **`re.ASCII` flag on secret regexes** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) —
  Last commit changed `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` → `[\w-]` in `github_token` /
  `openai_api_key` / `google_api_key` / `jwt`, but Python's default
  `\w` is **Unicode-aware** (matches `ünicode`, `türkçe`, …), which
  would broaden the match universe to include non-ASCII chars that
  real credentials never contain. Added `flags=re.ASCII` to all four
  patterns so `\w` is restricted to ASCII. Patterns that already use
  explicit ASCII character classes (`aws_access_key`, `slack_token`,
  the explicit `[A-Z0-9]` ones) are unchanged.
- **`regex.md` Rule 1 corrected** — Previous wording stated
  `[A-Za-z0-9_]` and `\w` are equivalent in Python. They are not.
  Rewrote the rule with a side-by-side example showing the Unicode /
  ASCII divergence, plus a decision table: ASCII-only inputs → `\w`
  with `re.ASCII` (or explicit class), natural-language inputs →
  bare `\w` (Unicode-aware), mixed → be explicit.
- **CommonMark fence-length rule enforced** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`
  + `forgelm/ingestion.py`) — CommonMark §4.5 requires the closing
  fence to use **at least as many** fence characters as the opener.
  Both `_strip_code_fences` and `_markdown_sections` previously
  tracked only the fence character, so a 4-backtick opener (` ```` `)
  was prematurely closed by a 3-backtick line. `_is_code_fence_open`
  now returns `(char, run_length)`; `_is_code_fence_close` accepts
  the minimum run-length and rejects shorter closes. The markdown
  splitter's `_MARKDOWN_CODE_FENCE` regex captures the fence run
  (`(?P<fence>...)`) and the rest of the line (`(?P<rest>...)`) so
  the splitter can also enforce "no info string on close" alongside
  the length rule. All three CommonMark §4.5 close-side rules
  (matching char + run length ≥ open + no info string) now hold.
- **`data_audit.md` reframes `[ingestion-secrets]`** — The doc
  previously implied installing the extra layered `detect-secrets`
  on top of the regex fallback. The current code does not invoke
  `detect-secrets` at all. Reworded as forward-compatibility:
  installing the extra is safe to pin in requirements files but
  doesn't change audit behaviour today.
- **`README` clarifies `semantic` chunking strategy** — Listed as
  reserved/planned: the implementation raises `NotImplementedError`
  and the CLI hides it from `--strategy` choices. Previous wording
  implied it was available at runtime.
- **`ingestion-tr.md` CLI synopsis adds Phase 12 flags** —
  `--strategy markdown` and `--secrets-mask` now appear in the
  options block; short Turkish description for each.
- **`review-pr` skill heading updated** — "The six-question review"
  → "The seven-question review" to match the regex-check question
  added in the previous commit.
- **`data_curation.ipynb` fixture credentials fragmented** —
  `deploy_runbook.txt` fixture now builds `AKIA…` / `ghp_…` strings
  at runtime from inert fragments (same convention as
  `tests/test_data_audit_phase12.py::FAKE_AWS_KEY`). Repo-wide
  secret scanners no longer flag the notebook source.
- **`data_curation.ipynb` MinHash install uses the project extra** —
  `pip install 'datasketch>=1.6.0,<2.0.0'` →
  `pip install 'forgelm[ingestion-scale]==0.5.2'` so the recipe
  matches the install hint baked into
  `forgelm.data_audit._require_datasketch`.
- **`TestMinHashDistinctSemantic` uses pytest's `tmp_path`** — Was
  creating a directory under `tests/` which mutated the repo and
  broke parallel pytest runs. Now uses the standard `tmp_path`
  fixture; no manual cleanup needed.
- **3 new fence-length regression tests** in
  `tests/test_phase12_review_fixes.py::TestFenceRunLengthRule`:
  4-backtick block not closed by 3 backticks; `_strip_code_fences`
  respects the length rule; close lines with info strings are
  treated as content (CommonMark §4.5 conformance).

### Added — Regex hygiene standard

- **New standard `docs/standards/regex.md`** — codifies 8 hard rules absorbed from Phase 11/11.5/12 review cycles (no `[A-Za-z0-9_]` shorthand, no single-char character classes, bound your quantifiers, no two competing quantifiers over the same class, no `\s` under MULTILINE, no `.*?` + back-reference + DOTALL, anchored `^` / `$`, no leading `^.*`). Each rule cites the concrete review finding that produced it. Includes a ReDoS-exposure budget (10K-char pathological-input benchmark must stay ≤ 10ms) and test fixture hygiene rules (build credential-shaped strings from inert fragments at runtime). Linked from `coding.md`, `code-review.md`, the `review-pr` skill, and `CLAUDE.md`'s "read before editing" entry point.
- **`code-review.md` checklist gains a regex section** — explicit `git diff` recipe to surface modified `re.compile` / `re.match` / `re.sub` calls + per-regex audit checklist.
- **`review-pr` skill gains a regex check** — same checklist, applied during self-review before opening a PR.

### Fixed — Phase 12 review cycle round 2.5 (post-`30ef590`)

Round-2.5 review surfaced two confirmed ReDoS shapes that the earlier rounds missed; the regex hygiene sweep above also caught a handful of style-only deviations across the codebase.

- **ReDoS confirmed in `_MARKDOWN_HEADING_PATTERN`** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`) — Old pattern `[ \t]+(.+?)[ \t]*$` had three quantifiers competing for trailing whitespace; pathological input `"# a" + " \t" * n + "x"` ran in O(n²) time (100ms at n=2000, 600ms at n=5000, 2.1s at n=10000 measured in CPython 3.11). Replaced with a non-whitespace anchor on the body capture: `[ \t]+(\S(?:[^\n]*\S)?)[ \t]*$`. Result: linear (10μs at n=10000 — 200000× speedup).
- **`_CODE_FENCE_BLOCK` regex replaced with state machine** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — Old form used `.*?` + back-reference + `re.DOTALL`, which SonarCloud `python:S5852` flags as a polynomial-runtime risk even though it benchmarks linearly in CPython. Replaced with a per-line state machine (`_strip_code_fences` + `_is_code_fence_open` + `_is_code_fence_close`) that is provably O(n) and matches the same line-walker pattern as `_markdown_sections`. Behaviour pinned bit-for-bit on 7 fixtures.
- **`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` → `[\w-]`** in `openai_api_key`, `google_api_key`, `jwt` (3 places) regexes per regex.md rule 1.
- **`\s*$` → `[ \t]*$`** in `_PUNCT_END_PATTERN` (callers pre-split into single lines, so the `\s` newline-overlap is dead weight) per regex.md rule 5.
- **Bounded `_HF_HUB_ID_RE`** (`forgelm/wizard.py`) — `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` → `[\w.-]{1,96}` (HF Hub username + repo name max length) per regex.md rule 3 — defence-in-depth, no behaviour change for well-formed HF IDs.

### ReDoS regression tests

- **New `TestRegexLinearity` class in `tests/test_phase12_review_fixes.py`** — pinned 1-second wall-clock cap on N=10000 pathological inputs for both `_MARKDOWN_HEADING_PATTERN` and `_strip_code_fences`. A real ReDoS would blow far past the threshold; a slow CI host won't false-positive.
- **Empirical sweep over all 25 forgelm regexes** confirmed linear scaling under 50K-character adversarial input. Slowest pattern (`openssh_private_key`, full-block PEM) measures 0.5ms — ~10μs/KB. The sweep is reproducible via the snippet documented in regex.md.

### Fixed — Phase 12 review cycle round 2 (post-`bf8ca82`)

Second-round review of the Phase 12 commit surfaced 22 findings spanning correctness, regex coverage, code-smell hygiene, type widening, and documentation parity. All addressed.

- **Private-key blocks redacted in full** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — Old `openssh_private_key` / `pgp_private_key` regexes only matched the `BEGIN` header line, so `mask_secrets` left the entire base64 body + `END` line in clear text. Now both patterns match the full PEM/PGP envelope (BEGIN through matching END inclusive) under `re.DOTALL`. The literal block markers are split across `r"-----" + r"BEGIN " + r"..."` concatenations to keep repo-wide secret scanners (gitleaks / trufflehog) silent.
- **Fenced code blocks recognise tildes too** (`forgelm/data_audit.py` + `forgelm/ingestion.py`) — `_CODE_FENCE_BLOCK` (audit's quality-filter strip) and `_MARKDOWN_CODE_FENCE` (ingest's markdown splitter) only matched triple-backtick fences; CommonMark §4.5 also allows `~~~`. Both now recognise either fence character with up to 3 leading spaces. The markdown splitter additionally tracks the *opening* fence character so a stray `\`\`\`` inside a `~~~` block (or vice-versa) doesn't toggle state.
- **DOCX block order preserved** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`: `_iter_docx_blocks`) — `_extract_docx` previously appended every paragraph followed by every table, reordering content. New helper walks `doc.element.body` in source order, dispatches on `<w:p>` vs. `<w:tbl>`, and renders each block in place.
- **Markdown overlap rejected explicitly** — `_strategy_dispatch` and `_strategy_dispatch_tokens` raise `ValueError` when `--strategy markdown` is combined with a non-zero overlap, rather than silently dropping it. To keep the CLI's historical default `--overlap 200` from spuriously tripping the validator on a `--strategy markdown` invocation that didn't ask for overlap, `--overlap`'s argparse default is now `None`; `ingest_path` resolves that sentinel to `200` for the sliding strategy and `0` for paragraph / markdown.
- **`minhash_distinct` counts unique sketches** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — Previously returned the count of non-empty rows, breaking parity with `simhash_distinct` (which is *unique fingerprints*). Now hashes each MinHash via `m.hashvalues.tobytes()` and counts the distinct set, matching simhash semantics.
- **`_row_quality_flags` typed `Optional[str]`** — The function already accepted `None` at runtime; the signature now reflects that and the test's `# type: ignore[arg-type]` suppression is gone.
- **Cognitive-complexity refactors** — `_row_quality_flags` (CCN 22 → ≤ 10 via per-check helpers `_check_low_alpha_ratio` / `_check_low_punct_endings` / `_check_abnormal_mean_word_length` / `_check_short_paragraphs` / `_check_repeated_lines`); `find_near_duplicates_minhash` (CCN 21 → ≤ 10 via `_build_minhash_lsh` + `_emit_minhash_pair`); `audit_dataset` (CCN 21 → ≤ 12 via `_fold_outcome_into_summary` + `_build_quality_summary` + `_build_near_duplicate_summary`).
- **Regex / lint code-smells** — `[A-Za-z0-9_]` → `\w` in the GitHub PAT pattern; `[ ]{0,3}` → ` {0,3}` (single-char class collapsed) in markdown patterns; `\s` → `[ \t]` in heading pattern (mitigates the polynomial-backtracking concern SonarCloud flagged); duplicate `"chunk_tokens must be positive"` / `"max_chunk_size must be positive"` literal strings extracted to module constants `_CHUNK_TOKENS_POSITIVE_MSG` / `_CHUNK_SIZE_POSITIVE_MSG`; `_MARKDOWN_OVERLAP_UNSUPPORTED_MSG` constant for the new validator; comprehension `["| " + " | ".join(c for c in row) + " |"]` simplified to `["| " + " | ".join(row) + " |"]`.
- **Documentation parity** — `docs/guides/data_audit.md` quality-filter bullet list and JSON example now include `repeated_lines` and a note about code-fence stripping. `docs/guides/ingestion-tr.md` mirrors the EN guide's chunking-strategies table (markdown row added) and gains a new "secrets/credential masking (Phase 12)" section. `CHANGELOG`'s Phase 12 entry no longer overstates the `[ingestion-secrets]` extra: the regex set is the sole detection backend in v0.5.2, and the `detect-secrets` package is reserved for a follow-up release. `README` separates "From PyPI" and "From a local clone" install blocks so copy-paste users don't hit `-e .` confusion.
- **Test fixtures fragmented** — All hardcoded credential / JWT literals in `tests/test_data_audit_phase12.py`, `tests/test_ingestion_phase12.py`, and `tests/test_phase12_review_fixes.py` now built at runtime from inert string fragments (e.g. `"AKIA" + "IOSFODNN7" + "EXAMPLE"`). The regex still has to match the canonical shape, but no full literal credential lives in the source tree — silences gitleaks / trufflehog scans of the repo without changing behaviour.
- **5 new round-2 regression tests** (`tests/test_phase12_review_fixes.py`) — `TestTildeFenceRecognised` (~~~-fenced code blocks block heading splits), `TestPrivateKeyFullBlock` (full PEM body redaction), `TestMarkdownOverlapValidation` (rejection on explicit non-zero overlap; default-overlap pass-through), `TestMinHashDistinctSemantic` (unique-sketches semantic).
- **Notebook ruff format** — `notebooks/post_training_workflow.ipynb` reformatted to satisfy `ruff format --check` in CI; `notebooks/data_curation.ipynb` install line pinned to `forgelm[ingestion]==0.5.2` rather than the moving `main` branch.

### Fixed — Phase 12 review cycle (post-`2f5722a`)

Round-1 review of the Phase 12 commit surfaced four critical regressions / bugs and several lower-severity issues. All addressed before tagging `v0.5.2`. No new functionality; only correctness, honesty, and parity fixes.

- **JSON envelope back-compat** (`forgelm/cli.py`) — `_run_data_audit`'s stdout JSON envelope dropped the v0.5.1 `near_duplicate_pairs_per_split` top-level key when the richer `near_duplicate_summary` block was added. Pre-Phase-12 CI consumers (`jq '.near_duplicate_pairs_per_split.train'`) would have started getting `null`. Restored as an additive key alongside the new one. Plan / CHANGELOG language updated from *"byte-identical default report"* to *"schema-additive"* — older parsers keep working, but on-disk JSON is no longer byte-identical because `secrets_summary`, `near_duplicate_summary.method`, and `cross_split_overlap.method` are now always present.
- **Quality filter completes the planned check set** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — Plan promised five Gopher / C4 / RefinedWeb-style heuristics; v0.5.2 shipped four. Added the missing `repeated_lines` check (top-3 actually-repeating distinct lines covering > 30 % of non-empty lines flag the row — pinned on count ≥ 2 so short all-unique documents don't false-positive). Surfaces in `quality_summary.by_check.repeated_lines`.
- **Quality filter respects fenced markdown code** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`: `_strip_code_fences`) — Code blocks legitimately have low alpha ratio + missing end-of-line punctuation + short paragraphs and tripped every prose heuristic, polluting the `quality_summary` on legitimate code-instruct corpora. `_row_quality_flags` now strips fenced ``` … ``` blocks before applying the heuristics; pure-code rows return `[]` instead of being flagged on shape grounds.
- **DOCX table cells escape `|` and `\`** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`: `_escape_md_cell`) — `_docx_table_to_markdown` joined cell text directly into a markdown table row, so a cell containing `a|b` was parsed by downstream tokenisers as two extra columns. Now escapes `|` → `\|` and `\` → `\\` per CommonMark, and collapses embedded newlines to spaces (markdown tables can't carry multi-line cells).
- **JWT regex narrowed** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — Old pattern `\beyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\b` false-positived on prose like `eyJfoo.eyJbar.baz`. Anchored on the canonical JWT header alphabet (`alg` / `typ` / `kid` / `cty` / `enc` / `api`'s base64url prefixes — `hbGc`, `0eXA`, `raWQ`, `jdHk`, `lbmM`, `hcGk`) plus minimum lengths on payload and signature. Real JWTs (including the original test fixture) still match; arbitrary `eyJ.eyJ.X`-shaped prose does not.
- **MinHash docstring honest about the metric** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`) — `compute_minhash` previously claimed it surfaces "the same class of near-duplicates" as simhash. The two use different similarity metrics (set-Jaccard over distinct tokens vs. frequency-weighted bit-cosine) and disagree on documents with high token-frequency variance. Docstring rewritten to make the divergence explicit. Roadmap "byte-identical" wording corrected in the same spirit.
- **CommonMark indented headings recognised** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`) — `_MARKDOWN_HEADING_PATTERN` and `_MARKDOWN_CODE_FENCE` allow up to 3 leading spaces per CommonMark §4.2; 4+ spaces still fall through as indented code blocks (correctly *not* split as headings).
- **Cog complexity restored to ≤ 15** — `_aggregator_to_info` (split into `_populate_schema_block` / `_populate_optional_findings` / `_within_split_pairs`) and `_markdown_sections` (split into `_push_heading_onto_path` / `_trim_blank_edges`) factored to stay under the Phase 11.5 ceiling.
- **Defensive lazy import in `compute_minhash`** — Empty input now returns `None` without paying the `_require_datasketch()` raise path. Same effect for `_count_leaked_rows_minhash` when the entire target list is empty (LSH-construction skipped).
- **Mask-order rationale honest** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`: `_emit_chunk`) — Old docstring claimed today's regex sets overlap; in practice the shipped fixtures show no overlap. Rewritten to describe the ordering as *defensive* (favour secrets when ordering matters at all; future-proof against new PII / secret regexes that may overlap, e.g. Azure connection strings vs. IBANs).
- **Markdown chunkers document the no-overlap contract** — `_chunk_markdown` and `_chunk_markdown_tokens` docstrings explicitly state that `--overlap` / `--overlap-tokens` are silently ignored when `--strategy markdown` is selected (sections are atomic; overlapping would slice mid-section and break the breadcrumb invariant).
- **Type hints tightened** — `IngestionResult.format_counts` / `pii_redaction_counts` / `secrets_redaction_counts` and the local counters in `ingest_path` typed as `Dict[str, int]` instead of bare `dict`.
- **Turkish documentation parity** (`docs/guides/data_audit-tr.md`) — Three Phase 12 H3 sections (MinHash LSH, Code/secret tagger, Heuristic quality filter) were missing from the TR mirror; added at the same detail level as the EN guide.
- **18 regression tests** (`tests/test_phase12_review_fixes.py`) — One class per finding, pinning the fixes against re-introduction. Covers the JSON envelope shape, `repeated_lines` detection on real boilerplate vs. all-unique short docs, DOCX `|` / `\` / newline escaping, JWT header-alphabet anchors with the prose-shape false-positive, code-fence stripping in the quality filter, the token-aware markdown chunker (previously untested), and CommonMark 0-3-space indented headings.

### Added — Phase 12 (Data Curation Maturity, targeting v0.5.2)

Direct continuation of the Phase 11 / 11.5 ingestion + audit lineage. Closes the four concrete gaps surfaced by the post-`v0.5.1` competitive review (LLaMA-Factory / Axolotl / Unsloth / NeMo Curator / Dolma / RedPajama / LlamaIndex / LangChain / Marker / Docling). Tier 1 (5 must-have tasks) shipped; Tier 2/3 (Presidio adapter, Croissant metadata, `--all-mask`, wizard "audit first") deferred to a [Phase 12.5 backlog](docs/roadmap/completed-phases.md).

- **MinHash LSH dedup option** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`: `compute_minhash`, `find_near_duplicates_minhash`, `_count_leaked_rows_minhash`) — Opt-in `--dedup-method minhash --jaccard-threshold 0.85` route via the optional `[ingestion-scale]` extra (`datasketch>=1.6.0`). Default simhash + LSH banding from Phase 11.5 stays untouched and remains the only method that runs without an optional dependency. `audit_dataset(...)` API gains `dedup_method`, `minhash_jaccard`, `minhash_num_perm` parameters; `near_duplicate_summary.method` records which path ran. Cross-split overlap + within-split duplicate scan share the same method flag. MinHash is approximate (permutation noise; default `num_perm=128`) — pin `num_perm` for cross-run determinism.
- **Markdown-aware splitter** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`: `_chunk_markdown`, `_chunk_markdown_tokens`, `_markdown_sections`, `_heading_breadcrumb`) — New `--strategy markdown` parses heading hierarchy (`# H1` … `###### H6`), keeps code-fenced blocks atomic (heading-shaped lines inside ```` ``` ```` blocks are not interpreted as section boundaries), and inlines a heading **breadcrumb** at the top of each chunk so SFT loss sees the document context. Composes with the Phase 11.5 token-aware mode (`--chunk-tokens` + `--tokenizer`).
- **Code / secret leakage tagger** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`: `detect_secrets`, `mask_secrets`, `_SECRET_PATTERNS`) — Always-on audit-side scan with a **prefix-anchored regex set** (the sole detection backend in this release) covering AWS access keys (`AKIA…` / `ASIA…`), GitHub PATs (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghs_`, `ghu_`, `ghr_`, `github_pat_`), Slack tokens, OpenAI API keys (`sk-…` / `sk-proj-…`), Google API keys, JWTs anchored on canonical header alphabet, full OpenSSH / RSA / DSA / EC / PGP private-key blocks (BEGIN through END inclusive — `mask_secrets` redacts the entire block, not just the header line), and Azure storage connection strings. Adds a `secrets_summary` block alongside `pii_summary`. Ingest side: `forgelm ingest --secrets-mask` rewrites detected spans with `[REDACTED-SECRET]`; runs **before** PII masking as a defensive ordering so future overlapping detectors (PII vs secret regex) can't double-count. The optional `[ingestion-secrets]` extra (`detect-secrets>=1.5.0`) is reserved for a follow-up release — the current code does **not** invoke the `detect-secrets` package (its plugin model assumes file paths, not streaming chunks); install only as forward-compatibility for the eventual integration.
- **Heuristic quality filter** (`forgelm/data_audit.py`: `_row_quality_flags`, `_QUALITY_CHECKS`) — Opt-in `forgelm audit --quality-filter` runs Gopher / C4 / RefinedWeb-style checks per row: `low_alpha_ratio` (< 70 % letters among non-whitespace), `low_punct_endings` (< 50 % of non-empty lines end with punctuation), `abnormal_mean_word_length` (outside 3–12 chars), `short_paragraphs` (> 50 % of `\n\n`-blocks have < 5 words). Surfaces `quality_summary` with per-check counts, `samples_flagged`, and `overall_quality_score`. ML-based classifiers (fastText / DeBERTa) deliberately out of scope — keeps the audit deterministic for Annex IV reproducibility.
- **DOCX / Markdown table preservation** (`forgelm/ingestion.py`: `_docx_table_to_markdown`) — `_extract_docx` now renders tables as markdown table syntax (header row + `---` separator + body rows) instead of the previous `" | "`-joined flat line. Uneven rows are right-padded with empty cells; all-blank rows are dropped; the first non-empty row becomes the header (no heuristic — that's the convention DOCX authors use). Combined with `--strategy markdown` the table block stays intact across chunks.

### Public API additions

- `AuditReport` gains `secrets_summary: Dict[str, int]` and `quality_summary: Dict[str, Any]` fields (additive — Phase 11/11.5 consumers reading just `pii_summary` / `near_duplicate_summary` keep working).
- `IngestionResult` gains `secrets_redaction_counts: dict` field.
- `audit_dataset(...)` accepts `dedup_method`, `minhash_jaccard`, `minhash_num_perm`, `enable_quality_filter` keyword arguments.
- `ingest_path(...)` accepts `secrets_mask: bool` keyword argument.
- New constants: `DEDUP_METHODS`, `DEFAULT_MINHASH_JACCARD`, `DEFAULT_MINHASH_NUM_PERM`, `SECRET_TYPES`.

### CLI additions

- `forgelm ingest`: `--strategy markdown`, `--secrets-mask`.
- `forgelm audit`: `--dedup-method {simhash,minhash}`, `--jaccard-threshold X` (validated to `[0.0, 1.0]` at parse time), `--quality-filter`.
- New argparse type helper `_non_negative_float` (mirrors `_non_negative_int`'s pattern).
- `_run_data_audit` now distinguishes `EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR` (filesystem/path errors) from `EXIT_TRAINING_ERROR` (missing `[ingestion-scale]` extra when `--dedup-method=minhash` was requested).

### `pyproject.toml`

- New extras: `[ingestion-scale]` (`datasketch>=1.6.0,<2.0.0`), `[ingestion-secrets]` (`detect-secrets>=1.5.0,<2.0.0`).
- Version bump `0.5.1rc1 → 0.5.2rc1`.

### Tests

- `tests/test_data_audit_phase12.py` — 18 new tests across `TestSecretsDetection`, `TestSecretsMasking`, `TestAuditPicksUpSecrets`, `TestQualityFilterPerRow`, `TestQualityFilterEnabled`, `TestMinHashLshDedup` (skipped without `datasketch`), `TestMinHashMissingExtra`.
- `tests/test_ingestion_phase12.py` — 13 new tests across `TestMarkdownSections`, `TestChunkMarkdown`, `TestMarkdownStrategyExposed`, `TestDocxTableToMarkdown`, `TestSecretsMaskIngest`.
- `tests/test_cli_subcommands.py` — `test_audit_quality_filter_flag`, `test_audit_rejects_invalid_jaccard_threshold` added to `TestAuditSubcommand`.

### Changed (no behavioural delta unless noted)

- `_StreamingAggregator` gains `minhashes`, `secrets_counts`, `quality_flags_counts`, `quality_samples_flagged`, `dedup_method`, `minhash_num_perm`, `enable_quality_filter` fields. Field rename: `_SplitOutcome.fingerprints` → `_SplitOutcome.signatures` (the same field carries simhash ints OR MinHash instances, depending on method).
- `_audit_split(...)` now returns `(info, signatures, pii_split, parse_errors, decode_errors)` where `signatures` is method-dependent. `_process_split` and `audit_dataset` were updated in lockstep.
- `_pair_leak_payload` and `_cross_split_overlap` switched to keyword-only `dedup_method` parameter and dispatch on it (simhash → Hamming; minhash → Jaccard).
- `describe_strategies()` now lists `markdown` alongside `sliding` / `paragraph` / `semantic`.

### Added — Phase 11.5 (Ingestion / Audit Polish, targeting v0.5.1)

Operational polish on top of `v0.5.0`'s ingestion + audit surface — no new training capabilities, but materially better handling for large corpora and a cleaner CLI shape. All 12 follow-ups carved out of Phase 11's review backlog.

- **`forgelm audit PATH` subcommand** — Promotes the `--data-audit` top-level flag to a first-class subcommand with `--verbose`, `--near-dup-threshold`, and its own `--output` default (`./audit/`). The legacy `forgelm --data-audit PATH` flag keeps working as a deprecation alias and logs a one-line notice; existing CI pipelines need no changes. Removal targeted no earlier than `v0.7.0`.
- **LSH-banded near-duplicate detection** (`find_near_duplicates`, `_count_leaked_rows`) — Pigeonhole-banded LSH (default `bands = threshold + 1`) drops within-split + cross-split scans from `O(n²)` to ~`O(n × k)`. Recall stays exact at the default Hamming threshold; brute-force fallback remains for edge thresholds where bands shrink below 4 bits. Unblocks audits on 100K+ row corpora.
- **Streaming `_read_jsonl_split`** — The audit's JSONL reader is now a generator yielding `(row, parse_err, decode_err)`; `_audit_split` consumes it row-by-row via a `_StreamingAggregator` so RAM stays bounded on multi-million-row splits. Per-line tolerance semantics (parse errors, decode errors, non-dict rows) preserved.
- **Token-aware ingestion** (`--chunk-tokens`, `--tokenizer`, `--overlap-tokens`) — Optional flags on `forgelm ingest` size chunks against an HF `AutoTokenizer.encode` instead of raw character counts, so chunks line up with `model.max_length` exactly. `--tokenizer` is required with `--chunk-tokens` (we refuse to default to a hidden vocab because the chunk count would silently differ per-model). `trust_remote_code=False` is hard-pinned for safety.
- **PDF page-level header / footer dedup** (`_strip_repeating_page_lines`) — Lines that recur as the first or last non-empty line on ≥ 70 % of a PDF's pages (company watermarks, page numbers, copyright lines) are stripped automatically before chunking. Reduces audit `near_duplicate_pairs` noise on long policy / book PDFs. Skipped on documents shorter than 3 pages.
- **PII severity tiers** — Audit JSON now carries a `pii_severity` block (`total`, `by_tier`, `by_type`, `worst_tier`) alongside the flat `pii_summary`. Tiers map regulatory weighting: `credit_card` / `iban` → critical (PCI-DSS), national IDs → high (GDPR Art. 9), `email` → medium, `phone` → low. The aggregate notes line leads with the worst tier (`WORST tier: CRITICAL`) so reviewers cannot miss it.
- **`summarize_report` truncation policy** — Default `verbose=False` folds zero-finding splits into a single tail line so multi-split summaries stay short; `--verbose` on the new `audit` subcommand reverses this for full output. Has no effect on the on-disk JSON report.
- **Structured ingestion notes** — `IngestionResult.extra_notes` keeps the human-readable list; new `notes_structured: {key: value}` (and an explicit `pdf_header_footer_lines_stripped` field) carries machine-readable counts for CI/CD consumers. JSON output exposes both.
- **Wizard "ingest first" entry point** — `_offer_ingest_for_directory` + `_prompt_dataset_path_with_ingest_offer`: BYOD quickstart and the full 8-step wizard now offer to run `forgelm ingest` inline when the typed dataset path is a directory of raw documents, then feed the produced JSONL straight back into the BYOD path. Closes the onboarding loop end-to-end.
- **xxhash backend for simhash + token-level memo** — Optional `xxhash.xxh3_64` digest path (added to `forgelm[ingestion]`); BLAKE2b stays as the fallback. The Python-level speedup is modest (~1.3× raw, ~1.05× end-to-end after the cache below absorbs Zipfian repeats — xxhash's "4-10×" figure refers to C-level pure-hash microbenchmarks, not the Python wrapping path). The bigger wall-clock win is the new module-scope `lru_cache(maxsize=10_000)` that memoises the per-token digest — most corpora's token traffic is dominated by a few thousand frequent tokens, so the cache hit rate is very high.
- **Atomic audit-report write** — `data_audit_report.json` is now written via `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.replace` so a crashed audit can never leave a half-written report on disk. `newline="\n"` pinned for byte-exact reproducibility across Windows / Linux / macOS.

### Tests

- `tests/test_data_audit.py` — `TestLshBandedNearDuplicates` (LSH parity vs. brute force + high-threshold fallback), `TestPiiSeverity` (critical-tier verdict + neutral case), `TestSummarizeVerbosePolicy` (clean splits folded vs. expanded), `TestAtomicWrite` (no `.tmp` leftovers), `TestStreamingReader` (per-line tuple yields), `TestTokenCachePerformance` (cross-text cache hits).
- `tests/test_ingestion.py` — `TestPdfHeaderFooterDedup` (multi-page header/footer collapse, short-doc skip, no-repeats pass-through), `TestStructuredIngestionNotes`, `TestTokenAwareCli` (validates the `--chunk-tokens` requires `--tokenizer` rule).
- `tests/test_cli_subcommands.py` — `TestAuditSubcommand` (subcommand happy path, JSON envelope, legacy `--data-audit` alias).
- `tests/test_wizard_byod.py` — refreshed for the new ingest-first wording (empty directory rejection, decline-the-ingest-offer path).

### Changed — Phase 11 (no behavioural delta unless noted)

- `AuditReport` gains a `pii_severity: Dict[str, Any]` field. JSON consumers reading only `pii_summary` continue to work; the new field is additive.
- `find_near_duplicates(fingerprints, *, threshold, bits=64)` accepts a `bits` keyword for adaptive banding (default 64 matches `compute_simhash`).
- `_read_jsonl_split` is now a generator. The legacy buffered tuple return is gone — callers that were materialising rows can wrap with `list(...)`.
- `_audit_split(split_name, path, ...)` now takes a path instead of an in-memory list; `_process_split` calls it directly. Returns `(info, fingerprints, pii_split, parse_errors, decode_errors)` so OSError handling stays in the orchestrator.

### Previously added — Phase 11

**Document Ingestion & Data Audit (Phase 11)** — bridges raw enterprise corpora (legal, medical, policy manuals) to ForgeLM's training data format and surfaces governance signals before training starts.

- **`forgelm/ingestion.py`** + **`forgelm ingest`** subcommand:
  - Multi-format extractors: PDF (`pypdf`), DOCX (`python-docx`), EPUB (`ebooklib` + `beautifulsoup4`), TXT, Markdown.
  - Two chunking strategies: `paragraph` (default; greedy, never splits a paragraph) and `sliding` (fixed window with `--overlap`). `semantic` raises `NotImplementedError` and is reserved for a follow-up phase.
  - Output is `{"text": "..."}` JSONL — recognized as pre-formatted SFT input by `forgelm/data.py` without further preprocessing.
  - `--recursive` walks directory trees; unsupported extensions are skipped silently, supported files with no extractable text skip with a warning.
  - `--pii-mask` redacts detected PII spans before chunks land in the JSONL (shared regex set with the audit module).
  - OCR is intentionally out of scope; scanned PDFs without a text layer warn and produce zero chunks.

- **`forgelm/data_audit.py`** + **`forgelm --data-audit`** top-level flag:
  - Per-split metrics: sample count, column schema, text length distribution (`min/max/mean/p50/p95`), null/empty rate, top-3 language detection (best-effort via `langdetect`).
  - 64-bit simhash near-duplicate detection within each split; Hamming-distance threshold 3 ≈ 95% similarity (canonical web-page-dedup setting).
  - Cross-split overlap report — guards against silent train-test leakage that destroys benchmark fidelity.
  - PII regex set (`email`, `phone`, `credit_card` Luhn-validated, `iban`, `tr_id` checksum-validated, `de_id`, `fr_ssn`, `us_ssn`); per-split + aggregate counts.
  - Layout: single `.jsonl` file → treated as `train`; directory containing `train.jsonl` / `validation.jsonl` / `test.jsonl` (any subset) auto-discovered.
  - Writes `data_audit_report.json` under `--output` (default `./audit/`); `--output-format json` mirrors the report on stdout for CI/CD pipelines.
  - CPU-only; no GPU, no network.

- **EU AI Act Article 10 integration** — `generate_data_governance_report` now inlines `data_audit_report.json` under the `data_audit` key when present in the trainer's `output_dir`. Compliance bundle becomes a single self-contained document instead of a pointer.

- **`pyproject.toml` `[ingestion]` extra** — `pypdf`, `python-docx`, `ebooklib`, `beautifulsoup4`, `langdetect`. Cross-platform, no native compilation.

- **Tests** — `tests/test_ingestion.py` (TXT path + chunking strategies; PDF round-trip skips when `pypdf` missing) and `tests/test_data_audit.py` (PII regex + Luhn / TC Kimlik validators, simhash properties, end-to-end audit on file + split-keyed directory layouts, governance integration). All GPU/network-free.

- **Documentation** — new guides at `docs/guides/ingestion.md` and `docs/guides/data_audit.md`; README feature section, CLI epilog, install matrix, and roadmap status updated.

## [0.4.5] — 2026-04-26

### Added

**Quickstart Layer (Phase 10.5)** — One-command bundled templates with opinionated defaults. Primary community-growth driver: closes the gap between "I just installed ForgeLM" and "I have a fine-tuned model running locally."

- **`forgelm/quickstart.py`** — Template registry + orchestrator:
  - `Template` (frozen dataclass) — `name`, `title`, `description`, `primary_model`, `fallback_model`, `trainer_type`, `estimated_minutes`, `min_vram_for_primary_gb`, `bundled_dataset`, `license_note`.
  - `TEMPLATES: Dict[str, Template]` — 5 entries: `customer-support`, `code-assistant`, `domain-expert`, `medical-qa-tr`, `grpo-math`.
  - `auto_select_model(template, available_vram_gb)` — picks primary model when VRAM ≥ threshold (10–12 GB), fallback otherwise; explicit `no-gpu-detected` reason when CUDA is absent.
  - `_detect_available_vram_gb()` — wraps `torch.cuda.mem_get_info()`; returns `None` when no GPU (test mock point).
  - `run_quickstart(template_name, *, model_override, dataset_override, output_path, dry_run, available_vram_gb)` → `QuickstartResult` — copies seed dataset, substitutes `model.name_or_path` and `data.dataset_name_or_path`, writes `configs/<template>-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.yaml`. Generated YAML is identical in shape to a hand-written one — same trainer, same schema.
  - `format_template_list()`, `summarize_result(result)` — text/JSON renderers for CLI use.

- **`forgelm quickstart <template>` CLI subcommand** (in `forgelm/cli.py`):
  - `--list` — prints the registry; honors top-level `--output-format json` for CI.
  - `--model <id>` — override auto-selected model.
  - `--dataset <path>` — override the bundled seed dataset (required for `domain-expert`).
  - `--output <path>` — custom YAML output path (default: `./configs/<template>-<timestamp>.yaml`).
  - `--dry-run` — generate config only; skip training and chat.
  - `--no-chat` — train but skip the post-training chat REPL.
  - On a successful run, subprocess-invokes `forgelm --config <out>` and then `forgelm chat <output_dir>` (unless `--no-chat`).

- **Wizard integration** — `forgelm --wizard` now opens with "Start from a template?":
  - Yes → routes to the quickstart selector; the wizard becomes a thin shell over `run_quickstart()`.
  - No → falls through to the existing 8-step interactive flow.
  - No bifurcation: identical code paths and YAML schema downstream.

- **5 bundled templates** under `forgelm/templates/`:
  - `customer-support/` — Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct primary, SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct fallback. SFT trainer. 58-example seed JSONL in `{"messages": [...]}` format.
  - `code-assistant/` — Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct primary, Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct fallback (code-tuned smaller variant, not generic SmolLM2). SFT. 59-example Python/programming Q&A.
  - `domain-expert/` — Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct primary, SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct fallback. BYOD; empty data with a README explaining how to pair with `forgelm ingest` (Phase 11) or a custom JSONL.
  - `medical-qa-tr/` — Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct primary, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct fallback (Turkish-capable, not English-only SmolLM2). SFT, 49 Turkish Q&A; every answer ends with "Tıbbi acil durumlarda 112'yi arayın..." (medical-disclaimer guardrail).
  - `grpo-math/` — Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct primary, Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct fallback. GRPO trainer (`grpo_num_generations: 4`). 40 grade-school math word problems in prompt-only format, each carrying a `gold_answer` field for the built-in regex correctness reward.

- **Conservative defaults** in every template config:
  - QLoRA 4-bit NF4, LoRA rank=8, `per_device_train_batch_size=1`, gradient checkpointing on, safety eval / compliance artifacts opt-in only.
  - Designed so the smallest fallback model + the bundled seed dataset run end-to-end on a 12 GB consumer GPU.

- **`forgelm/templates/LICENSES.md`** — Full attribution for bundled seed datasets (CC-BY-SA 4.0, author-original); contributing guide for new templates; medical-disclaimer note for `medical-qa-tr`.

- **`pyproject.toml` `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`** — bundles `*.yaml`, `*.jsonl`, `*.md` under `forgelm.templates` into the wheel so `pip install forgelm` users get the templates without a source checkout.

- **GRPO baseline reward** — `forgelm/grpo_rewards.py` ships a default reward bundle so prompt-only datasets don't crash inside `trl.GRPOTrainer`. When `grpo_reward_model` is unset the trainer wires `combined_format_length_reward` (0.8 × format-match + 0.2 × length-shaping); if the dataset additionally carries a `gold_answer` field (the bundled `grpo-math` seed does), `_math_reward_fn` is appended so TRL sums correctness on top of format teaching.

- **Tests** — All GPU-independent via TRL/torch FSDP-aware skip-if pattern:
  - `tests/test_quickstart.py` — registry consistency, bundled-asset shape, `auto_select_model` primary/fallback/no-gpu, end-to-end `run_quickstart`, CLI dispatch, regression test that loads every generated YAML through `load_config` (strongest guard against template drift).
  - `tests/test_quickstart_hardening.py` — PR review hardening (path validation, model override edges, dry-run wiring).
  - `tests/test_grpo_math_reward.py` — pure-Python unit tests for `_normalize_answer`, `_answers_match`, `_math_reward_fn`, `_dataset_has_gold_answers`.
  - `tests/test_grpo_format_reward.py` — `format_match_reward`, `length_shaping_reward`, `combined_format_length_reward`, plus trainer integration.
  - `tests/test_wizard_byod.py` — wizard BYOD dataset path validation (existence, directory, malformed JSONL, valid JSONL, HF Hub IDs, `~` expansion).
  - `tests/test_cli_quickstart_wiring.py` — `--offline` propagation, separate chat inheritance, chat exit-code 0/130 handling.
  - `tests/test_packaging.py` — wheel `package_data` smoke (catches editable-install-only template paths).
  - `tests/test_grpo_reward.py` — extended with no-reward-model + gold-answer wiring assertions.

- **CI** — `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`:
  - Per-template quickstart smoke (4 of 5 — `domain-expert` is BYOD and covered by pytest).
  - New `wheel-install-smoke` job: builds the wheel, installs it into a fresh venv from `/tmp` (so the source tree is off `sys.path`), and reruns `quickstart --list` + `quickstart --dry-run` to catch broken `package_data` globs that editable installs hide.

### Documentation

- New "Option 0: One-Command Quickstart Template" section at the top of `docs/guides/quickstart.md`.
- `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/roadmap-tr.md`, `docs/roadmap/completed-phases.md`, `docs/roadmap/releases.md` updated to mark Phase 10.5 as Done.
- `README.md` quickstart section updated to lead with `forgelm quickstart`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

**Post-Training Completion (Phase 10)**

- **`forgelm/inference.py`** — Shared generation primitives for all post-training features:
  - `load_model(path, adapter, backend, load_in_4bit, load_in_8bit, trust_remote_code)` — loads HF model + tokenizer; optional PEFT adapter merge via `merge_and_unload()`; unsloth backend support
  - `generate(model, tokenizer, prompt, *, messages, system_prompt, history, max_new_tokens, temperature, top_k, top_p, repetition_penalty)` — non-streaming text generation
  - `generate_stream(...)` — streaming via `TextIteratorStreamer` in daemon thread; yields token chunks
  - `logit_stats(logits)` — returns `{entropy, top1_prob, effective_vocab}` for token-level confidence inspection
  - `adaptive_sample(logits, temperature, top_k, top_p, entropy_threshold)` — greedy below entropy threshold, nucleus sampling above
  - `_build_prompt` — uses `tokenizer.apply_chat_template` when available; falls back to `"role: content\n"` join

- **`forgelm/chat.py`** — Interactive terminal REPL (`ChatSession` class + `run_chat()` entry point):
  - Streaming output by default; `--no-stream` flag for non-streaming
  - Slash commands: `/reset`, `/save [file]`, `/temperature N`, `/system [prompt]`, `/help`, `/exit`
  - History management with 50-turn cap (`_MAX_HISTORY_PAIRS`)
  - Optional `rich` rendering via `pip install forgelm[chat]`
  - Optional `--safety` flag routes each response through Llama Guard

- **`forgelm/fit_check.py`** — VRAM pre-flight advisor:
  - `estimate_vram(config)` → `FitCheckResult(verdict, estimated_gb, available_gb, breakdown, recommendations)`
  - Verdicts: `FITS` (< 85% GPU), `TIGHT` (85-95%), `OOM` (> 95%), `UNKNOWN` (no GPU)
  - Architecture loaded via `transformers.AutoConfig`; fallback size-hint dict for 7b/8b/13b/70b families
  - VRAM components: base weights + LoRA adapter + optimizer state (AdamW/8-bit/GaLore-aware) + activations (gradient-checkpointing divides by √layers)
  - `format_fit_check(result)` — human-readable summary; `--output-format json` for CI/CD
  - Hypothetical mode when no CUDA detected — still estimates based on architecture

- **`forgelm/export.py`** — GGUF model export:
  - `export_model(model_path, output_path, *, format, quant, adapter, update_integrity, extra_args)` → `ExportResult`
  - Wraps `llama-cpp-python`'s `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` — no reimplementation of conversion logic
  - Supported quantizations: `q2_k`, `q3_k_m`, `q4_k_m`, `q5_k_m`, `q8_0`, `f16`
  - **K-quant note**: `q2_k`/`q3_k_m`/`q4_k_m`/`q5_k_m` require a two-step flow.
    `forgelm export ... --quant q4_k_m model.gguf` produces an intermediate
    `model.f16.gguf`; run `llama-quantize model.f16.gguf model.gguf Q4_K_M`
    afterward to obtain the K-quant. The `ExportResult.quant` field reflects
    what was actually written (so `model_integrity.json` SHA-256 stays honest)
  - Adapter merge: loads base + PEFT, saves merged fp16 weights before conversion
  - `_sha256_file` — chunked 64 KB reads for large models
  - `_update_integrity_manifest` — appends export artifact (path, quant, sha256, size_bytes) to `model_integrity.json`
  - Optional dependency: `pip install forgelm[export]` (`llama-cpp-python>=0.2.90`)

- **`forgelm/deploy.py`** — Deployment config file generation:
  - `generate_deploy_config(model_path, target, output_path, *, system_prompt, max_length, temperature, top_k, top_p, ...)` → `DeployResult`
  - Target `ollama`: Modelfile with FROM, SYSTEM (double-quote escaped), PARAMETER directives
  - Target `vllm`: YAML engine config with GPU memory utilization, dtype, trust_remote_code
  - Target `tgi`: docker-compose.yaml with GPU resource reservation, port mapping, max-input/total-length
  - Target `hf-endpoints`: JSON spec with model repository, task, compute instance, region, framework
  - Case-insensitive target matching; default output filenames per target

- **CLI subcommands** (`forgelm/cli.py`):
  - `forgelm chat MODEL_PATH [--adapter] [--system] [--temperature] [--max-new-tokens] [--safety] [--no-stream] [--load-in-4bit] [--load-in-8bit] [--trust-remote-code] [--backend]`
  - `forgelm export MODEL_PATH --output FILE [--format gguf] [--quant q4_k_m] [--adapter] [--no-integrity-update]`
  - `forgelm deploy MODEL_PATH --target TARGET [--output FILE] [--system] [--max-length] [--temperature] [--top-k] [--top-p] [--trust-remote-code]`
  - `forgelm --config CONFIG --fit-check [--output-format json]`
  - All subcommands work without `--config`; backward-compatible with existing flat CLI

- **Optional extras** in `pyproject.toml`:
  - `forgelm[export]` — `llama-cpp-python>=0.2.90` (non-Windows)
  - `forgelm[chat]` — `rich>=13.0.0`

- **New test modules**:
  - `tests/test_inference.py` — 16 tests covering `_build_prompt`, `_to_messages`, `logit_stats`, `adaptive_sample`, `load_model`, `generate` with custom torch stub (no GPU required)
  - `tests/test_fit_check.py` — 18 tests covering parameter estimation, VRAM components, GPU scenarios (no CUDA, 4 GB, 80 GB), `format_fit_check`
  - `tests/test_export.py` — 12 tests covering SHA-256, integrity manifest, GGUF export flow with subprocess mock
  - `tests/test_deploy.py` — 21 tests covering all 4 target generators and `generate_deploy_config` integration
  - `tests/test_cli_phase10.py` — 22 tests covering `--fit-check`, all deploy targets, export subcommand, chat subcommand, subcommand routing

### Changed

- **`forgelm/__init__.py`** — version bumped to `0.4.0`
- **`forgelm/cli.py`** — added subparser architecture with `chat`, `export`, `deploy` subcommands; added `--fit-check` flag; `KeyboardInterrupt` caught in chat dispatch for graceful exit
- **`forgelm/wizard.py`** — (no changes needed; Phase 10 features are all CLI-driven, not wizard-driven)

### Breaking

- **`forgelm.compliance.export_compliance_artifacts`** signature changed from
  `(manifest, config, output_dir)` to `(manifest, output_dir)`. The `config`
  argument was unused (the manifest already contains all derived values).
  External callers must drop the second positional argument.
- **`forgelm.export.export_model`** keyword `format=` renamed to
  `output_format=` to avoid shadowing the `format` builtin. Update
  `export_model(..., format="gguf", ...)` → `export_model(...,
  output_format="gguf", ...)`.
- **`forgelm.deploy.generate_deploy_config`** parameter list collapsed from
  18 → 11 args. The HF Endpoints fields (task/instance_size/instance_type/
  region/framework/vendor) are now grouped as
  `hf_endpoints: HFEndpointsOptions = None`; sampling defaults
  (temperature/top_k/top_p) are grouped as
  `sampling: SamplingOptions = None`. Pass instances of those dataclasses
  instead of the individual kwargs.
