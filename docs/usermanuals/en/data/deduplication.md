# Near-Duplicate Detection

Duplicates and near-duplicates inflate your training distribution towards whatever's repeated, and — when they straddle train/eval splits — make your evaluation metrics meaningless. ForgeLM ships two algorithms: simhash for accuracy and small-to-medium corpora, MinHash LSH for scale.

## Algorithm choice

| Algorithm | Recall | Speed | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LSH-banded simhash** (default) | Exact within Hamming threshold | ~50K rows/sec | Corpora < 50K rows |
| **MinHash LSH** | Approximate (>95% of true duplicates) | ~500K rows/sec | Corpora > 50K rows |

Override the default via `--dedup-method {simhash,minhash}`.

## Quick example

```shell
$ forgelm audit data/train.jsonl --near-dup-threshold 3
⚠ near-duplicate pairs: 47 (LSH-banded simhash, threshold 3)

$ jq '.near_duplicates[]' audit/data_audit_report.json | head
{"row_a": 1240, "row_b": 4521, "hamming": 1, "similarity": 0.984}
{"row_a": 9012, "row_b": 9013, "hamming": 0, "similarity": 1.0}
```

A `hamming: 0` means *exact* duplicates (same simhash); higher values are progressively less similar.

## Threshold tuning

The `--near-dup-threshold` is a Hamming distance on the 64-bit simhash. Defaults are:

| Threshold | Captures | False-positive rate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Exact duplicates only | ~0% |
| 1-2 | Trivial-edit duplicates ("Hello!" vs "Hello.") | <1% |
| **3** (default) | Paraphrases with shared structure | 1-2% |
| 5+ | Loose paraphrases; high false-positive rate | 5-15% |

Most teams stick with 3.

## What near-dup catches that exact-match doesn't

```text
Row A: "Welcome to our customer support. How can I help you today?"
Row B: "Welcome to our customer support — how can I help you today?"
```

Exact-match misses these (different punctuation). Simhash with threshold 3 catches them.

```text
Row A: "Send your CV to ali@example.com"
Row B: "Send your CV to ali@example.com or call us"
```

Threshold 3 also catches these (same first half, slight extension).

## Cross-split awareness

Audit runs near-dup detection both *within* and *across* splits. Cross-split duplicates are the high-priority bug — they make your benchmark scores unreliable. Audit's `cross_split_overlap` field reports how many train rows have a near-duplicate in validation or test. See [Cross-Split Leakage](#/data/leakage).

## MinHash LSH for scale

For corpora over 50K rows, switch to MinHash:

```shell
$ forgelm audit data/large.jsonl --dedup-method minhash --jaccard-threshold 0.85
✓ near-duplicate pairs: 1,247 (MinHash LSH, threshold 0.85)
```

MinHash trades small accuracy for big speed — typical recall is >95% of true duplicates while running 10× faster than simhash on million-row datasets.

| MinHash flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dedup-method minhash` | Switch from the default simhash detector to MinHash LSH. Requires the `forgelm[ingestion-scale]` extra (datasketch). |
| `--jaccard-threshold` | Jaccard similarity threshold (default 0.85). Ignored under simhash. |

Permutation count and LSH banding are not user-tunable today — they are fixed at the library defaults that benchmark cleanly across the 50K-to-1M-row range. Track [Phase 13 roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/cemililik/ForgeLM/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md) for the planned `forgelm[ingestion-scale]` knobs to expose them.

## Streaming behaviour

Both algorithms are streaming — they don't load the whole dataset into memory. A 10M-row corpus dedupes in a few minutes on a laptop CPU.

## Removing duplicates

`forgelm audit` *detects* duplicates; it doesn't remove them. Removal is a separate, opt-in step driven by the `audit:` block of your YAML config (so the run is reproducible and audited end-to-end). See the `audit.deduplication` section in [Configuration Reference](#/reference/configuration) for the canonical knobs:

```yaml
audit:
  deduplication:
    method: simhash          # or 'minhash'
    near_dup_threshold: 3    # simhash Hamming distance
    jaccard_threshold: 0.85  # MinHash similarity
    write_clean_output: data/train.dedup.jsonl
    keep_split: train        # cross-split tiebreak
```

Re-run `forgelm audit data/train.jsonl` with that config to materialise the cleaned JSONL.

When duplicates are within a single split, ForgeLM keeps the first occurrence. Across splits, it keeps the train-side row by default and removes from validation/test (configurable via `keep_split`).

## Common pitfalls

:::warn
**Threshold too aggressive.** Hamming threshold 5+ on simhash will flag legitimately different examples as duplicates. Stick with 3 unless you've measured false-positive rate on your specific data.
:::

:::warn
**MinHash recall depends on the permutation count.** ForgeLM ships datasketch defaults (≥128 permutations) that keep recall above 95%. Manual override is on the [Phase 13 roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/cemililik/ForgeLM/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md) — until then, do not rely on a `--num-perm` flag (it does not exist).
:::

:::tip
**Run dedup BEFORE manually splitting train/val/test.** If your splits are produced upstream and have leakage, you can't fix that with deduplication; you have to re-split. Audit on the combined dataset before splitting catches this.
