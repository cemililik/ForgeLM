# Your First Run

This page walks you through a complete training run, from a fresh `pip install` to a finished checkpoint with audit artifacts. Allow ~5 minutes of reading and ~30 minutes of GPU time.

## 1. Verify your environment

Before anything else, run `forgelm doctor` to check that Python, PyTorch, CUDA, and any optional dependencies are wired up correctly:

```shell
$ forgelm doctor
forgelm doctor — environment check

  [✓ pass] python.version          Python 3.11.4 (CPython).
  [✓ pass] torch.cuda              torch 2.4.0 with CUDA 12.4.
  [✓ pass] gpu.inventory           1 GPU(s) — GPU0: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24.0 GiB).
  [✓ pass] extras.qlora            Installed (module bitsandbytes, purpose: 4-bit / 8-bit QLoRA training).
  [✓ pass] extras.unsloth          Installed (module unsloth, purpose: Unsloth-accelerated training (Linux GPUs only)).
  [! warn] extras.deepspeed        Optional extra missing — install with: pip install 'forgelm[deepspeed]' (purpose: DeepSpeed ZeRO + offload distributed training).
  [✓ pass] hf_hub.reachable        HuggingFace Hub reachable (HTTP 200).
  [✓ pass] disk.workspace          Workspace /home/me/forgelm — 387.0 GiB free of 500.0 GiB.
  [! warn] operator.identity       FORGELM_OPERATOR not set; audit events will fall back to 'me@workstation'. Pin FORGELM_OPERATOR=<id> for CI / pipeline runs.

Summary: 7 pass, 2 warn, 0 fail.
```

`--output-format json` returns a structured envelope (`{"success": bool, "checks": [...], "summary": {...}}`) so CI can filter on individual probe results without parsing the table. Pass `--offline` to skip the HF Hub network probe and inspect the local cache instead — useful for air-gapped deployments.

:::tip
If `forgelm doctor` reports a problem (missing CUDA, version mismatch, no GPU), fix that first. Every other ForgeLM command will fail in confusing ways otherwise. See [Troubleshooting](#/operations/troubleshooting).
:::

## 2. Pick a bundled template

ForgeLM ships with five starter templates that cover most real-world fine-tuning scenarios. List them:

```shell
$ forgelm quickstart --list
  customer-support     Multi-turn helpful + safe (SFT + DPO)
  code-assistant       Code-completion fine-tune (SFT + ORPO)
  domain-expert        PDF/DOCX corpus → domain Q&A (SFT)
  medical-qa-tr        Turkish medical Q&A (SFT)
  grpo-math            Step-by-step reasoning (GRPO)
```

For your first run, pick `customer-support` — it's small, finishes in ~30 minutes on a 12 GB GPU, and exercises every feature (SFT, DPO, eval, safety, audit):

```shell
$ forgelm quickstart customer-support
Wrote configs/quickstart-customer-support.yaml
```

The generated YAML is yours to keep, edit, and version-control. Open it.

## 3. Validate the config (`--dry-run`)

Always validate before training. `--dry-run` parses your YAML, checks every referenced file exists, downloads metadata for the model and tokenizer, and reports any structural problems — without using a single GPU second:

```shell
$ forgelm --config configs/quickstart-customer-support.yaml --dry-run
✓ config validates
✓ datasets reachable
✓ tokenizer downloadable
✓ output directory writable
```

:::warn
A failing `--dry-run` is a configuration problem, not a training problem. Fix it before going further. Most "training crashed at step 0" reports trace back to skipped dry-runs.
:::

## 4. Estimate VRAM (`--fit-check`)

Different models, different `max_length`, different LoRA ranks all change peak memory. `--fit-check` runs a static analysis and reports whether your job will fit:

```shell
$ forgelm --config configs/quickstart-customer-support.yaml --fit-check
FITS  est. peak 11.4 GB / 12 GB available
```

Possible verdicts:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FITS` | Comfortably within VRAM budget. Proceed. |
| `TIGHT` | Within budget but no headroom for activation bursts. Reduce `max_length` or batch size. |
| `OOM` | Will not fit. Suggested fixes printed (e.g. enable QLoRA, lower batch size). |
| `UNKNOWN` | Architecture not in the GPU profile database — train conservatively or report. |

## 5. Train

```shell
$ forgelm --config configs/quickstart-customer-support.yaml
[2026-04-28 14:01:32] config validated
[2026-04-28 14:01:33] auditing data/customer-support.jsonl (12,400 rows, 3 splits)

[2026-04-28 14:33:04] ✔ finished, exit 0
```

## 6. Try the model

```shell
$ forgelm chat ./checkpoints/customer-support
forgelm> how do I cancel my subscription?
You can cancel from Settings → Billing → Cancel subscription. Your access
continues until the end of the current billing period…
```

## What you got on disk

```text
checkpoints/customer-support/
├── artifacts/
│   ├── annex_iv_metadata.json              ← Article 11 technical documentation
│   ├── audit_log.jsonl            ← Article 12 append-only event log
│   ├── data_audit_report.json     ← Article 10 data governance evidence
│   ├── safety_report.json         ← Llama Guard verdict
│   ├── benchmark_results.json     ← Per-task accuracy
│   └── manifest.json              ← SHA-256 over every artifact
├── README.md                      ← Article 13 model card
├── config_snapshot.yaml           ← The exact YAML this run used
└── adapter_model.safetensors      ← LoRA weights (or merged checkpoint)
```

That `artifacts/` directory is the deliverable for compliance reviews. Every file inside is hashed in `manifest.json` for tamper-evidence.
