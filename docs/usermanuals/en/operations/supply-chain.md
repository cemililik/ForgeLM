# Supply Chain

ForgeLM emits a CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM per release tag, and runs `pip-audit` + `bandit` nightly via the `nightly.yml` workflow (also re-run on every release-tag publish). This page is the operator's mental model: what runs when, where to get the artefacts, and how to mirror the same checks locally.

## What runs when

| Trigger | Tool | Result | Failure policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Release tag (`v*`) | `tools/generate_sbom.py` | One CycloneDX 1.5 JSON per (OS × Python-version) cell, attached to the GitHub release | SBOM step is pure-stdlib; cannot silently degrade a green release matrix |
| Nightly 03:00 UTC | `pip-audit` (via `tools/check_pip_audit.py`) | OSV / GHSA scan against installed deps | HIGH/CRITICAL → exit 1 + GitHub issue; MEDIUM → `::warning::`; LOW → silent |
| Nightly 03:00 UTC + release tag | `bandit` (via `tools/check_bandit.py`) | Static security scan of `forgelm/` (excludes `tests/`) | HIGH → exit 1; MEDIUM → `::warning::`; LOW → silent |

## Where to get the SBOM

```bash
# All SBOMs for a release.
gh release download v0.5.5 --pattern 'sbom-*'

# Pretty-print one.
jq . sbom-ubuntu-latest-py3.11.json | less

# Diff between two releases (lists added/removed dependencies).
diff <(jq -S '.components | sort_by(.purl)' sbom-prev.json) \
     <(jq -S '.components | sort_by(.purl)' sbom.json)

# Ingest into Dependency-Track for CVE correlation.
curl -X POST -H "X-Api-Key: $DT_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    --data-binary @sbom-ubuntu-latest-py3.11.json \
    https://deptrack.example.com/api/v1/bom
```

The SBOM is determinism-pinned — two consecutive emissions on the same Python environment produce content-identical JSON (modulo `serialNumber` and `metadata.timestamp`, both intentionally varying per CycloneDX semantics).

## Mirror the nightly check locally

Before pushing a PR, run the same check ForgeLM's nightly enforces:

```bash
pip install 'forgelm[security]'
pip-audit --strict --format json --output /tmp/pip-audit.json
python3 tools/check_pip_audit.py /tmp/pip-audit.json
```

Exit 0 means the same severity policy ForgeLM CI applies passed. Exit 1 means a HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerability needs addressing before the nightly fires.

## Mirror the bandit check locally

```bash
pip install 'forgelm[security]'
bandit -r forgelm/ -f json -o /tmp/bandit.json
python3 tools/check_bandit.py /tmp/bandit.json
```

`tests/` is excluded because test fixtures legitimately use insecure patterns (`assert`, dummy secrets). Production code under `forgelm/` is the scope.

## When a CVE is acknowledged but not yet fixable

If upstream has not yet released the fix and you've documented the CVE in your deployer-side risk acceptance log:

```bash
pip-audit --ignore-vuln <CVE-ID> --strict --format json --output /tmp/pip-audit.json
```

ForgeLM does **not** ship a project-level ignore list — every suppression is deployer-side and should be quarterly-reviewed.
