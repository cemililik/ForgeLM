# Performance

ForgeLM's hot paths are in the model forward pass, the safety classifier, the LLM-as-judge generation, and (for ingestion) the corpus chunker. This page lists the knobs that move those paths; the deep guide walks each tradeoff honestly.

## What's actually slow

Don't tune what isn't slow. Order of operations:

1. **Profile first.** `forgelm` prints stage timings; the slow stage is where you tune.
2. **Lazy imports help process startup, not training.** If `forgelm --help` is slow, lazy imports help. If your GPU step is slow, profile the trainer.
3. **Model size + sequence length × batch dominate.** No knob here saves you from a model that doesn't fit; pick a smaller model or a shorter context first.

## The four knobs that matter most

### `evaluation.safety.batch_size`

Pad-longest batching for the Llama Guard classifier. Default `8`. Going up: faster eval, more VRAM. Going down: slower eval, fits on smaller cards. See the [tradeoff table](#/reference/configuration) for VRAM at each setting.

### `evaluation.llm_judge.batch_size`

Same shape as safety eval, for local-model judging. Irrelevant when judging via API (the API rate-limits independently).

### `ingestion.strategy`

`paragraph` for SFT corpora that must not start mid-thought. `sliding` for retrieval corpora where overlap matters. `markdown` for structured docs. `semantic` is roadmapped, not shipped.

### Memory levers (4-bit, GaLore, sample packing)

Three orthogonal tools to fit a model that otherwise wouldn't. They're for **fitting**, not **speed** — speed comes from a bigger batch or longer context once the model fits.
