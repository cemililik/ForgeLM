# Exit Codes

ForgeLM's exit codes are a public contract. CI/CD pipelines, schedulers, and dashboards depend on them. They will not silently change between releases.

## The contract

| Exit | Constant | Meaning | Typical CI action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | `EXIT_SUCCESS` | Run completed; all gates passed; checkpoint promoted. | Continue pipeline |
| **1** | `EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR` | YAML invalid, file missing, env var unset, or argument malformed. | Fail fast |
| **2** | `EXIT_TRAINING_ERROR` | Training-time runtime error (any unhandled exception that isn't a config or eval-gate failure: data load, OOM, NaN loss, I/O failure, mid-stream audit-iteration OSError). | Investigate; surface logs |
| **3** | `EXIT_EVAL_FAILURE` | Benchmark or safety gate failed; auto-reverted if configured. | Investigate; do NOT promote |
| **4** | `EXIT_AWAITING_APPROVAL` | `evaluation.require_human_approval: true` blocking. | Hold pipeline; trigger reviewer |
| **5** | `EXIT_WIZARD_CANCELLED` | `forgelm --wizard` exited without producing a YAML — Ctrl-C, non-tty stdin refusal, or operator declined to save. Distinct from `EXIT_SUCCESS` so CI can tell "wizard finished" from "wizard never wrote anything". | Treat as no-op; surface message; do NOT continue with stale config |

These six integers are the entire public contract — see [`forgelm/cli/_exit_codes.py`](https://github.com/cemililik/ForgeLM/blob/main/forgelm/cli/_exit_codes.py) for the canonical definition. Any other non-zero value (including signal-derived 128+N codes) is clamped to `EXIT_TRAINING_ERROR` (2) before the process exits.

## Mapping to CI patterns

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Train
  id: train
  run: forgelm --config configs/run.yaml
  continue-on-error: true

- name: Block on regression
  if: steps.train.outcome == 'failure' && steps.train.conclusion == 'failure'
  run: |
    if [ "${{ steps.train.outputs.exit-code }}" = "3" ]; then
      echo "::error::Regression detected — see audit log"
      exit 1
    fi
```

For most pipelines, the simpler pattern is fine:

```yaml
- name: Train
  run: forgelm --config configs/run.yaml
  # Any non-zero exit fails the step. The artifact upload step still runs (if: always()).
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
train:
  script:
    - forgelm --config configs/run.yaml
  allow_failure:
    exit_codes: [4]                    # exit 4 (waiting for approval) doesn't fail CI
```

### Jenkins

```groovy
stage('Train') {
  steps {
    script {
      def status = sh(script: 'forgelm --config configs/run.yaml', returnStatus: true)
      if (status == 4) {
        currentBuild.result = 'UNSTABLE'   // hold for approval
      } else if (status != 0) {
        error "Training failed with exit code ${status}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## When to use each exit code

| Situation | What ForgeLM exits with |
|---|---|
| YAML has typo (e.g. `learnng_rate`) | 1 |
| `${HF_TOKEN}` set in YAML but env var missing | 1 |
| `--config` points to non-existent file | 1 |
| Final loss is NaN / OOM / I/O failure mid-training | 2 |
| `forgelm verify-audit` chain break or HMAC mismatch | 1 (during the v0.5.5 cycle EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR covers both option errors and integrity failures; see the in-manual [Verify Audit](#/compliance/verify-audit) page for the v0.6.x deprecation note) |
| DPO run, Llama Guard S5 regressed beyond tolerance | 3 |
| Benchmark hellaswag dropped below floor | 3 |
| `evaluation.require_human_approval: true` and no approval signed | 4 |
| User Ctrl+C (signal-derived 128+N) | 2 (clamped) |

## Programmatic determination

The exit code itself is the contract — read it via `$?` (POSIX shells), `%ERRORLEVEL%` (cmd), `$LASTEXITCODE` (PowerShell), or the equivalent in your CI runner's expression language (e.g. `steps.<id>.outputs.exit-code` in GitHub Actions, `returnStatus: true` in Jenkins). For richer postmortem context (regressed categories, restored checkpoint path, etc.), parse the structured `audit_log.jsonl` event written under the run's output directory rather than relying on a sidecar.

## What "exit 0" actually guarantees

A run that exits 0 has:
- Validated config without errors.
- Loaded the model and dataset.
- Completed all configured training steps.
- Passed every configured benchmark floor.
- Passed every configured safety threshold.
- Written the model card.
- Written the Annex IV bundle (if configured).
- Written manifest.json with SHA-256 over all artifacts.
- Optionally: written GGUF, deployment config.
- Closed the audit log with `pipeline.completed` (canonical event name).

If any of these failed, the exit code is non-zero. There is no "partial success" exit code by design.

## Compatibility guarantee

Exit codes 0-5 are stable across versions. New codes may be added (6, 7, ...) but existing ones won't change semantics. CI pipelines pinned to the contract above will continue working across ForgeLM upgrades.
