# QMS: Statement of Applicability (SoA)

> Quality Management System — [YOUR ORGANIZATION]
> ISO 27001:2022 Annex A — required by clause 6.1.3 d)
> Cross-reference: [`docs/design/iso27001_soc2_alignment.md`](../design/iso27001_soc2_alignment.md)
> for the full mapping rationale.

## 1. Purpose

The Statement of Applicability (SoA) is the deliverable an ISO 27001
auditor opens FIRST. It states, for every Annex A control, whether
your ISMS treats it as **applicable** or **excluded**, and the
justification.

This template is pre-populated from ForgeLM's own coverage map (see
the cross-referenced design doc). The deployer adapts each row to
their ISMS context — most rows stay applicable; a row that ForgeLM
covers natively (e.g. A.8.15 Logging) gives the deployer specific
ForgeLM-produced evidence to cite.

## 2. SoA matrix

Format: control ID → applicability → justification → ForgeLM
contribution → deployer-side action.

### 2.3 A.7 Physical controls (14) — typically EXCLUDED from a software-toolkit ISMS

These controls are excluded from ForgeLM's ISMS scope because ForgeLM
is a software toolkit. **The deployer's ISMS scope DOES include them
in their own SoA;** ForgeLM's exclusion here is purely about the
ForgeLM-specific control inventory.

## 3. Coverage tally

| Theme | Total | Applicable | Excluded (ForgeLM scope) | FL-supported | FL-helps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A.5 Organisational | 37 | 37 | 0 | 3 | 24 |
| A.6 People | 8 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 5 |

Row-by-row recount of §2.1–§2.4 above (the SoA matrix). Per-theme
tally — A.5: 3 / 24 / 10 OOS; A.6: 0 / 5 / 3 OOS; A.7: 0 / 0 / 14
OOS; A.8: 8 / 19 / 7 OOS — sums to 11 `FL` + 48 `FL-helps` + 34 OOS
= 93. Cross-check the design doc's §3 "Coverage tally" paragraph
(`docs/design/iso27001_soc2_alignment.md`);
the two must match.

## 4. Review

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | [DATE] | [AUTHOR] | Initial version (Wave 4 / Faz 23) — 93 controls scored against ForgeLM v0.5.5 |

Annual review cadence:

- Re-confirm applicability (rare changes — most controls stay
  applicable).
- Update ForgeLM-evidence column when a new ForgeLM phase ships.
- Update implementation-status column to reflect deployer-side
  control posture.
