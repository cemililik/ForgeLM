# SOP: Change Management for AI Models

> Standard Operating Procedure — [YOUR ORGANIZATION]
> EU AI Act Reference: Article 17(1)(b)(c)
> ISO 27001:2022: A.5.36, A.8.9, A.8.32
> SOC 2: CC8.1, CC3.4, CC5.3

## 1. Purpose

Define the procedure for managing changes to fine-tuned models, training configurations, and evaluation criteria.

## 2. Change Categories

| Category | Examples | Approval Required |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **Major** | New base model, new trainer type, risk category change | AI Officer + ML Lead |
| **Minor** | Hyperparameter tuning, LoRA rank change, dataset update | ML Lead |
| **Patch** | Bug fix, config formatting, documentation | ML Engineer (self-approve) |

## 3. Change Procedure

### 3.1 Propose

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b change/description`
2. Modify the training config (YAML)
3. Document the change rationale in the PR description
4. Run dry-run: `forgelm --config new_config.yaml --dry-run`

### 3.2 Review

1. Open a Pull Request against `main`
2. PR must include:
   - [ ] Config diff showing what changed
   - [ ] Rationale for the change
   - [ ] Expected impact on model quality/safety
   - [ ] For **Major** changes: updated risk assessment
3. Reviewer checks:
   - [ ] Config validates (`--dry-run` passes)
   - [ ] Safety evaluation enabled (for high-risk models)
   - [ ] No secrets or tokens in config

### 3.3 Execute

1. Merge PR (requires approval per branch protection rules)
2. CI/CD pipeline triggers training: `forgelm --config job.yaml`
3. ForgeLM auto-generates compliance artifacts for the new run
4. New `audit_log.jsonl` entries trace the change

### 3.4 Validate

1. Compare new model metrics against previous version
2. Review benchmark scores, safety scores, judge scores
3. If `require_human_approval: true`: explicit approval before deployment

### 3.5 Rollback

If the new model is worse:
- ForgeLM `auto_revert` handles automatic rollback during training
- For post-deployment rollback:
  1. Redeploy previous model version
  2. Document rollback in incident log
  3. Investigate root cause

## 4. CI gates as the formal change-control mechanism

Wave 4 / Faz 23 expansion: this section formalises which CI gates
constitute the deployer-facing change-control evidence. ISO A.8.32
demands "changes to information processing facilities and systems
shall be subject to change management procedures"; the table below
documents the procedure for ForgeLM-instrumented deployers.

| Gate | Tool | Failure mode | ISO control |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lint clean | `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .` | Style / syntax issues | A.8.28 |
| Pydantic field-description guard | `tools/check_field_descriptions.py --strict forgelm/config.py` | Operator-facing config drift | A.5.36 |
| HTTP discipline | `grep`-based regex guard in `ci.yml` | Undisciplined `requests.*` / `urllib.*` / `httpx.*` call | A.8.20 |
| Unit + integration tests | `pytest -q` | Regression on documented contract | A.8.29 |
| Coverage floor | `--cov-fail-under=40` (`pyproject.toml`) | Uncovered new code | A.8.29 |
| CLI dry-run | `forgelm --config config_template.yaml --dry-run` | Config schema break | A.8.9 |
| Site-as-tested-surface | `tools/check_site_claims.py --strict` | Marketing claim drift from code | A.5.31 |
| Bilingual H2/H3/H4 parity | `tools/check_bilingual_parity.py --strict` | EN/TR docs structural drift | A.5.36 |
| Bandit static-security (Wave 4) | `bandit -c pyproject.toml -r forgelm/` | High-severity finding | A.8.26, A.8.28 |
| pip-audit nightly (Wave 4) | `pip-audit --format json` | High-severity transitive CVE | A.8.8, A.8.21 |
| SBOM determinism (Wave 4) | `pytest tests/test_supply_chain_security.py` | SBOM content drift | A.5.21, A.8.8 |

A change cannot merge to `main` (or `development` for Wave-style
flows) until every gate passes. The PR review template (`.github/
PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) MUST require an explicit checkbox
confirming each gate green.

### 4.1 Approval gate as Change Advisory Board (CAB) substitute

For changes that produce a new training run (vs. configuration-only
changes), the **Article 14 staging gate** is the deployer's
in-pipeline CAB:

1. CI training job lands the model in `<output_dir>/staging_model.<run_id>/`.
2. `human_approval.required` audit event fires.
3. A reviewer (NOT the trainer) runs `forgelm approve --run-id <run_id>`.
4. `human_approval.granted` audit event fires; model promotes to
   `<output_dir>/final_model/`.
5. If rejected, `human_approval.rejected` event fires; model stays
   in staging until retention expires (`evaluation.approval_retention_days`).

This gives a deployer SOC 2 CC8.1 evidence: every model promotion is
attributed, dual-controlled, and forensically recorded.

### 4.2 Configuration drift detection

`tools/regenerate_config_doc.py` (Phase 16) regenerates
`docs/reference/configuration.md` (and `-tr.md` mirror) from the
Pydantic schema. CI runs the diff guard; a config-schema change
without a corresponding doc update fails the build.

This closes the "doc drift" failure mode where the schema evolves
but the operator-facing doc lags. ISO A.5.36 cites this as a
mandatory mechanism.

### 4.3 SBOM drift detection

`tools/generate_sbom.py` (Wave 2 era) produces a deterministic
CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM per (OS × Python-version) on every release tag
(`publish.yml`). Wave 4 adds a determinism contract test
(`tests/test_supply_chain_security.py::TestGenerateSbomDeterministic`).

Drift detection: a release's SBOM is reproducible from its `git tag`.
An auditor can re-emit it on demand and diff against the artefact
attached to the GitHub release.

## 5. Version Tracking

Every training run produces:
- `compliance_report.json` with ForgeLM version, config hash, timestamps
- `model_integrity.json` with artifact SHA-256 checksums
- `audit_log.jsonl` with full event history

Use these to trace any model back to its exact training configuration and data.

## 6. Review
