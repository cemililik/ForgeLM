# SOP: Data Management and Governance

> Standard Operating Procedure — [YOUR ORGANIZATION]
> EU AI Act Reference: Article 17(1)(f), Article 10

## 1. Purpose

Define standards for collecting, annotating, storing, and governing training data for LLM fine-tuning.

## 2. Scope

All datasets used for model training, validation, and evaluation.

## 3. Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Data Steward** | Data quality oversight, governance compliance |
| **ML Engineer** | Data preparation, preprocessing, format validation |
| **DPO (Data Protection Officer)** | Personal data assessment, DPIA review |

## 4. Data Collection

### 4.1 Requirements

- [ ] Document data source and collection method in config:
  ```yaml
  data:
    governance:
      collection_method: "Manual curation from internal knowledge base"
  ```
- [ ] Assess representativeness: does the data reflect the intended deployment context?
- [ ] Check for geographical, demographic, and contextual balance
- [ ] Document known biases in config:
  ```yaml
  data:
    governance:
      known_biases: "Dataset skewed toward English-speaking customers in EU region"
  ```

### 4.2 Personal Data

- [ ] Determine if dataset contains personal data
- [ ] If yes: complete Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
- [ ] Document in config:
  ```yaml
  data:
    governance:
      personal_data_included: true
      dpia_completed: true
  ```
- [ ] Ensure data minimization — only include necessary personal data
- [ ] Apply anonymization/pseudonymization where possible

## 5. Data Preparation

### 5.1 Annotation

- [ ] Document annotation process:
  ```yaml
  data:
    governance:
      annotation_process: "Two annotators per sample, adjudication by senior annotator"
  ```
- [ ] Maintain inter-annotator agreement records
- [ ] Version control annotation guidelines

### 5.2 Quality Checks

ForgeLM automated checks:
- Dataset fingerprinting (SHA-256 hash, size, timestamp)
- Format validation per trainer type (SFT, DPO, KTO, GRPO)
- Text cleaning (`clean_text: true`)
- **Audit pipeline (`forgelm audit <jsonl>`, v0.5.1+; legacy
  `forgelm --data-audit` still works)** — produces
  `data_audit_report.json` with per-split sample counts, length
  distribution, top-3 language detection, simhash near-duplicate rate
  (or **MinHash LSH** in v0.5.2 via `--dedup-method minhash` for
  >50K-row corpora), cross-split leakage check, PII flag counts
  (email / phone / Luhn-validated credit card / IBAN /
  TR–DE–FR–US national IDs) with **severity tiers** (v0.5.1) and
  always-on **secrets/credentials scan** (v0.5.2 — AWS / GitHub /
  Slack / OpenAI / Google / JWT / private-key headers). Optional
  **heuristic quality filter** (`--quality-filter`, v0.5.2) adds a
  `quality_summary` block. The report is auto-inlined into the EU AI
  Act Article 10 governance artifact when present in the trainer's
  `output_dir` — operators must run the audit **before** training to
  keep the bundle self-contained.
- **Ingestion pipeline (`forgelm ingest`, v0.5.0+; v0.5.2 added
  markdown-aware splitter + DOCX→markdown table preservation +
  `--secrets-mask`)** — turns raw PDF / DOCX / EPUB / TXT / Markdown
  into SFT-ready JSONL with optional `--pii-mask` and (v0.5.2)
  `--secrets-mask` to redact detected PII / credential spans before
  chunks reach storage.

Manual checks:
- [ ] Run `forgelm audit` and review `data_audit_report.json` for:
  cross-split leakage > 0%, near-duplicate rate, unexpected language mix,
  PII flag counts, **`secrets_summary` (v0.5.2 — any non-zero count is
  a stop-the-line event; remediate before training)**, and
  `quality_summary` if `--quality-filter` was used.
- [ ] Sample review: inspect 50+ random examples.
- [ ] Verify label correctness (for preference/KTO data).

## 6. Data Storage and Retention

- Training data stored in version-controlled or immutable storage
- SHA-256 fingerprint recorded in `data_provenance.json` for every training run
- Retain training data for minimum **5 years** alongside model artifacts
- Access restricted to authorized ML team members
