# ISO 27001 / SOC 2 Type II — ForgeLM Alignment Design

> **Scope:** Deployer evidence map showing how ForgeLM artefacts
> (audit-trail, change-management, data-governance, encryption-at-rest,
> incident-response records) populate the ISO 27001 / SOC 2 Type II
> control surface a deployer faces during certification audit. Living
> spec — kept in sync with the implementation under
> `docs/qms/`, `docs/reference/iso27001_control_mapping.md`,
> `docs/reference/soc2_trust_criteria_mapping.md`, the pip-audit /
> bandit CI guards, and the QMS documents.

**Important framing.** ForgeLM is a Python library + CLI. *Software cannot be
ISO 27001 certified* — only **organisations** running an ISMS can. What
ForgeLM *can* do is make a deployer's ISO 27001 certification audit AND a SOC 2
Type II audit demonstrably faster: the audit-trail, change-management,
data-governance, encryption, and incident-response evidence the auditor
requests is produced by ForgeLM as a byproduct of running the training
pipeline. This document is the deployer's evidence map.

The phrasing in customer-facing material is therefore **"ISO 27001 / SOC 2
Type II alignment"** — never "certified" / "compliant". The
README ISO / SOC 2 section follows this rule explicitly.

**Status:** Implemented in v0.5.5. See `CHANGELOG.md`,
`docs/guides/iso_soc2_deployer_guide.md`, and the QMS / reference
documents listed under §Scope above for the user-facing surface.

## 1. Background and scope

### 1.1 Why this matters

Most prospective deployers of an LLM fine-tuning toolkit operate inside an
organisation that already holds (or is pursuing) ISO 27001 + SOC 2 Type II. The
auditor will ask:

- *"Show me the audit trail for every training run that produced model X."*
- *"Show me the access controls — who approved the deployment, when?"*
- *"Show me the data lineage: where did the training set come from, what's its
  fingerprint?"*
- *"Show me the supply-chain inventory: what dependencies did this model
  process?"*
- *"Show me the incident response runbook: what happens if the safety
  classifier crashes during a run?"*
- *"Show me the encryption-at-rest policy for model weights and audit logs."*

Every one of these questions has a precise mechanical answer in ForgeLM's
current code surface. This document maps each ISO 27001:2022 Annex A control
and each SOC 2 Trust Services Criterion to that answer.

### 1.2 Audience

Three readers:

1. **The deployer's compliance team** — uses §3 (ISO Annex A mapping) and §4
   (SOC 2 TSC mapping) directly as audit evidence index.
2. **The deployer's engineering team** — uses §6–§8 (SBOM, vuln scanning,
   QMS docs) to integrate ForgeLM evidence into their own controls.
3. **The ForgeLM maintainer (Cemil)** — uses §13 (Faz 23 implementation
   plan) as the work breakdown for the next wave.

### 1.3 What ForgeLM is NOT in this framing

- **Not a substitute for the deployer's ISMS.** ForgeLM does not police
  organisational policies, employment contracts, physical security, or
  third-party vendor management. Annex A controls in those areas (A.5.x
  organisational, A.6.1–A.6.6 people, A.7.x physical) are deployer-side full
  stop.
- **Not a CA / certificate authority.** Salt + HMAC chain are tamper-evident,
  not non-repudiation in a PKI sense.
- **Not a SIEM / log aggregator.** ForgeLM emits audit events to a JSONL file;
  the deployer ships them to Splunk / Datadog / etc. via webhook or filebeat.
- **Not a key-management system.** ForgeLM consumes `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET`
  from the env; the deployer rotates the secret in their KMS.

This is the same "deployer-toolkit boundary" articulated in
`docs/marketing/strategy/05-yapmayacaklarimiz.md` and the root `CLAUDE.md`
"What ForgeLM is not" section.

### 1.4 Bağımlılıklar (closure-plan)

Faz 22 depends on every functional baseline that produces auditable evidence:

| Dep | Wave | What it gives Faz 22                              |
|-----|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| F-3 | W1   | Operator identity (`FORGELM_OPERATOR`, audit bind)|
| F-6 | W1   | `forgelm verify-audit` (chain integrity)          |
| F-7 | W1   | `safe_post` HTTP discipline (SSRF / TLS / scheme) |
| F-8 | W1   | Webhook lifecycle vocabulary                      |
| F-9 | W1   | Article 14 staging + `forgelm approve`/`reject`   |
| F-21| W2b  | GDPR Article 17 erasure (`forgelm purge`)         |
| F-38| W3   | GDPR Article 15 access (`forgelm reverse-pii`)    |

Wave 4 (this design + Faz 23 implementation) closes the deployer-cookbook
gap that previously existed.

audit-grade evidence (e.g. CLI argument parsing, Pydantic models for non-
compliance fields, training metric snapshots without HMAC).

## 3. ISO 27001:2022 Annex A control mapping

ISO 27001:2022 Annex A organises 93 controls into four themes:
- **A.5 Organisational** (37 controls)
- **A.6 People** (8 controls)
- **A.7 Physical** (14 controls)
- **A.8 Technological** (34 controls)

Each row classifies coverage as one of:

- **`FL`** — *ForgeLM-supported*: ForgeLM directly produces audit evidence.
- **`FL-helps`** — *Deployer responsibility, ForgeLM helps*: ForgeLM provides
  partial evidence the deployer combines with other sources.
- **`OOS`** — *Out of scope*: deployer-only, ForgeLM contributes nothing.

| A.8.31 Separation of development, test and production environments | FL-helps | `forgelm --dry-run` flag; staging dir (Phase 9); `evaluation.require_human_approval` gate | Separate pipelines |
| A.8.32 Change management | FL | `human_approval.required/granted/rejected` chain; `config_hash` (per-run manifest sidecar field); staging dir snapshot | Change Advisory Board process |
| A.8.33 Test information | FL-helps | `forgelm audit` flags PII / secrets in test sets too | Test-data-handling policy |
| A.8.34 Protection of information systems during audit testing | OOS | — | Read-only audit access |

**Coverage tally for §3:** 93 controls scored, recounted row-by-row
across §3.1–§3.4. **`FL` (full)**: 11 · **`FL-helps`**: 48 ·
**`OOS`**: 34. Per-theme split — A.5: 3 / 24 / 10; A.6: 0 / 5 / 3;
A.7: 0 / 0 / 14; A.8: 8 / 19 / 7. The OOS bucket is dominated by
A.7 physical (14) + A.5 organisational governance (10) + A.8 cloud /
network (7) — all expected for a deployer-side toolkit boundary.

## 4. SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria mapping

The 2017 SOC 2 framework (revised 2022) defines 5 categories:

- **Security** (Common Criteria CC1.x–CC9.x) — mandatory baseline.
- **Availability** (A1.x) — optional.
- **Processing Integrity** (PI1.x) — optional.
- **Confidentiality** (C1.x) — optional.
- **Privacy** (P1.x–P8.x) — optional.

A SOC 2 *Type II* audit observes operating effectiveness over a 6–12 month
window. Every Common Criteria control here is expected; the optional
categories are scoped per-engagement.

### 4.2 Availability (A1.x)

ForgeLM is a single-node CLI; availability is dominantly deployer-side.

| Control | ForgeLM contribution | Deployer responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| A1.1 Capacity planning | `forgelm doctor` resource report + `resource_usage` manifest block | Multi-AZ + autoscaling |
| A1.2 Recovery from incidents | `auto_revert` swap-back to baseline; audit chain continuity on resume | Runbook + drills |
| A1.3 Environmental protections | OOS | Datacenter UPS / generator |

### 4.3 Processing Integrity (PI1.x) — strong ForgeLM contribution

| Control | ForgeLM contribution |
|---|---|
| PI1.1 Quality of inputs | `compute_dataset_fingerprint` (SHA-256 + size + mtime); `data_governance_report` (collection_method, annotation_process, known_biases, personal_data_included, dpia_completed) |
| PI1.2 System processing | `forgelm verify-audit` validates HMAC chain end-to-end; `data_audit_report.json` flags PII / secrets / dedup before training |
| PI1.3 Outputs are accurate | `model_integrity.json` SHA-256 checksums per artefact; `model_card.md` with HF YAML front-matter |
| PI1.4 Inputs traceable | `_describe_adapter_method` canonicalisation; `pipeline.config_hash`; HF-revision pin |
| PI1.5 Outputs traceable | Annex IV bundle co-locates manifest + report + audit + integrity in one ZIP |

### 4.4 Confidentiality (C1.x)

| Control | ForgeLM contribution |
|---|---|
| C1.1 Protection of confidential information | `forgelm audit` regex + Presidio ML-NER PII detection; `_SECRET_PATTERNS` credentials scan; AWS / GitHub / Slack / OpenAI / Google / JWT key matchers |
| C1.2 Disposal of confidential information | `forgelm purge` Article 17 with salted-hash audit (no raw identifier in chain); `data.erasure_warning_memorisation` flags model-weight retention risk |

### 4.5 Privacy (P1.x – P8.x)

| Control | ForgeLM contribution |
|---|---|
| P1.1 Privacy notice | Article 13 `deployer_instructions.md` |
| P2.1 Choice and consent | `evaluation.require_human_approval` Article 14 gate |
| P3.1 Collection | `data.governance.personal_data_included` boolean; `dpia_completed` flag |
| P3.2 Quality of personal data | `data_audit_report.json` quality stats |
| P4.1 Use, retention, and disposal | `retention.staging_ttl_days` (canonical; legacy alias `evaluation.staging_ttl_days` forwards transparently during the v0.5.5 → v0.6.x deprecation window) + `forgelm purge --check-policy` retention audit |
| P5.1 Access | `forgelm reverse-pii` Article 15 scan; salted query-hash in audit |
| P5.2 Inquiries and complaints | (Deployer-side workflow) |
| P6.1 Disclosure to third parties | `safe_post` webhook discipline; HMAC payload signing |
| P6.2 Third-party agreements | (Deployer DPAs) |
| P7.1 Breach notification | `data.erasure_failed`, `audit.classifier_load_failed` events feed breach-detection |
| P7.2 Breach disclosure | (Deployer regulator-contact playbook) |
| P8.1 Inquiries, complaints, and disputes | `forgelm reverse-pii` + `forgelm purge` chain provides forensic evidence |

## 5. Gap assessment — what ForgeLM does NOT yet ship

Items that the closure plan + this design identify as gaps closed in
Faz 23, **not** as out-of-scope:

1. **`pip-audit` nightly integration.** SBOM exists; supply-chain CVE
   scanning does not. Faz 23 adds a nightly job that fails on
   high-severity findings.
2. **`bandit` CI integration.** Static security scan; `[tool.bandit]`
   config block exists in `pyproject.toml` but no workflow consumes it
   yet. Faz 23 wires it into `ci.yml`.
3. **`[project.optional-dependencies] security`** extra. Bundles
   `pip-audit` + `bandit` for installable security tooling.
4. **`docs/qms/encryption_at_rest.md`** + `-tr.md`. Operator-facing
   guidance for model weights / audit logs / training data encryption.
5. **`docs/qms/access_control.md`** + `-tr.md`. Multi-user pipelines;
   OS-level user isolation; `FORGELM_OPERATOR` rotation guidance.
6. **`docs/qms/risk_treatment_plan.md`** + `-tr.md`. Risk register
   format with ForgeLM identified-risk rows pre-filled.
7. **`docs/qms/statement_of_applicability.md`** + `-tr.md`. ISO Annex A
   × applicable / excluded × justification matrix (the table from §3
   reformatted as the QMS-style SoA).
8. **`docs/guides/iso_soc2_deployer_guide.md`** + `-tr.md`. Deployer-
   facing audit cookbook ("how to use ForgeLM evidence in your ISO /
   SOC 2 audit"). Step-by-step.
9. **`docs/reference/iso27001_control_mapping.md`** + `-tr.md`. The §3
   table as a reference doc (vs design-doc).
10. **`docs/reference/soc2_trust_criteria_mapping.md`** + `-tr.md`. The
    §4 table as a reference doc.
11. **README ISO/SOC 2 alignment section.** 1 paragraph + link to the
    deployer guide.
12. **`sop_incident_response.md` expansion.** ISO A.5.24–A.5.27 mapping;
    security-incident playbook that runs alongside the existing safety-
    incident text.
13. **`sop_change_management.md` expansion.** ISO A.8.32 mapping; CI
    gates explicitly named as the change-control mechanism.
14. **CHANGELOG entry.** Wave 4 / Faz 22-23 line.
15. **`tests/test_sbom.py::test_deterministic`.** Same git tree → byte-
    identical SBOM; pin determinism contract.

## 6. SBOM tooling — current state and Faz 23 additions

**What's already shipped (Wave 2 era):**

`tools/generate_sbom.py` produces CycloneDX 1.5 JSON (177 lines, pure
stdlib emitter). `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs it on every
release tag in the `cross-os-tests` job (line 94–101) and uploads
`sbom-<os>-py<version>.json` per (OS, Python) pair as artefacts.

**Why CycloneDX, not SPDX (closure-plan revision).** The closure plan
originally called for SPDX 2.3. The Wave 2 implementer chose CycloneDX
1.5 instead because:

- Both formats are ISO/SOC 2 auditable; auditors accept either.
- CycloneDX 1.5 has stronger first-class supply-chain semantics
  (vulnerability disclosures, BOM dependencies graph).
- `Dependency-Track` ≥ 4.10 — the most common open-source SBOM
  consumer — natively ingests CycloneDX 1.5.
- The existing emitter has zero external dependencies (pure stdlib +
  `importlib.metadata`).

Faz 23 keeps CycloneDX 1.5; SPDX format addition is deferred to a
later wave if a deployer specifically requests SPDX. (The deployer
guide in Faz 23 documents this choice and offers the user a
"convert with `cyclonedx-py`" recipe if SPDX is required.)

**What Faz 23 adds:**

- `tests/test_sbom.py::test_deterministic` — same input must produce
  byte-identical output.
- `tests/test_sbom.py::test_cyclonedx_schema_valid` — JSON validates
  against CycloneDX 1.5 schema (use `jsonschema` from optional dev
  extra, not at runtime).
- Documentation: `docs/reference/supply_chain_security.md` (+ TR)
  documenting the SBOM artefact, where to download it, how to
  consume it.

## 7. Vulnerability scanning — Faz 23 implementation plan

### 7.1 `pip-audit` (supply-chain CVE scan)

- **Where:** `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` (existing daily 03:00 UTC).
- **Step:**
  ```yaml
  - name: pip-audit (supply-chain CVE scan)
    if: always()  # run even if previous step soft-failed
    run: |
      pip install 'pip-audit>=2.7.0,<3.0.0'
      pip-audit --strict --format json --output /tmp/pip-audit.json || true
      python tools/check_pip_audit.py /tmp/pip-audit.json
  ```
- **Behaviour:** New helper `tools/check_pip_audit.py` parses the
  JSON; `high`-severity findings exit 1 (fail nightly); medium / low
  emit warnings via `::warning::` GitHub annotation.
- **Suppression:** When a CVE is acknowledged + tracked, list it in
  `tools/.pip-audit-ignore.json` with rationale + review date.

### 7.2 `bandit` (static code security)

- **Where:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (every PR + push).
- **Scope:** `forgelm/` only (`exclude_dirs = ["tests", ".venv", "build", "dist"]`
  already in `pyproject.toml`).
- **Step:**
  ```yaml
  - name: bandit (static security scan)
    run: |
      pip install 'bandit[toml]>=1.7.0,<2.0.0'
      bandit -c pyproject.toml -r forgelm/ -f json -o /tmp/bandit.json || true
      python tools/check_bandit.py /tmp/bandit.json
  ```
- **Behaviour:** New helper `tools/check_bandit.py` parses the JSON;
  `HIGH` severity exits 1, `MEDIUM` warns, `LOW` silent.
- **Suppression:** Inline `# nosec B101` (or whichever ID) with
  justification in a trailing comment on the same line.

### 7.3 Optional extra

`pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies]`:

```toml
security = [
  "pip-audit>=2.7.0,<3.0.0",
  "bandit[toml]>=1.7.0,<2.0.0",
]
```

Operators install via `pip install forgelm[security]` if they want
to run the same checks locally.

### 7.4 Determinism

The output of `pip-audit` is non-deterministic (depends on CVE
database state); the goal is "no high-sev finding", not bit-stability.
The output of `bandit` IS deterministic over a fixed code tree;
`tests/test_bandit_clean.py` (post-Faz-23) pins the exit-code-0
contract for a clean tree.

## 8. New QMS document plans

The four documents listed in §5 (#4–#7) are authored in Faz 23. Each
follows the existing QMS template style (see `docs/qms/sop_*.md` for
Wave 0 templates). Bilingual (`-tr.md` siblings).

### 8.1 `encryption_at_rest.md`

Outline (~150 lines):

1. Purpose — operator-facing guidance for what ForgeLM does NOT
   encrypt, and what the deployer must encrypt.
2. Scope — model weights (`final_model/`, `staging_model.<run_id>/`),
   audit logs (`audit_log.jsonl` + `.manifest.json`), training data
   (operator-supplied), config files (`config.yaml`).
3. Threat model — disk theft, backup theft, shared-tenancy disk
   leak, log-shipping intercept.
4. Recommended controls per asset class — LUKS / dm-crypt for whole-
   disk, S3 SSE-KMS for blob, GPG / age for individual files,
   `gpg-agent` for `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET`.
5. ForgeLM contribution — none structurally (operator chooses
   substrate); ForgeLM produces the auditable evidence on top.
6. Verification — `forgelm verify-audit` works on encrypted-at-rest
   audit logs as long as the operator decrypts before invoking; the
   audit chain itself is integrity-protected, encryption is
   confidentiality-only.

### 8.2 `access_control.md`

Outline (~180 lines):

1. Purpose — multi-user / multi-pipeline ForgeLM deployments.
2. `FORGELM_OPERATOR` env contract — required for every CI run; rotated
   when staff change.
3. OS-level isolation — separate Unix user per pipeline; `chmod 0700`
   on `output_dir`; `chown` on audit logs.
4. CI runner identity — best practice: GitHub Actions OIDC token →
   `FORGELM_OPERATOR=ci/<workflow>/<run_id>`.
5. Approval gate identity separation — trainer ≠ approver enforced
   by `forgelm approve` (audits operator id at approve time).
6. Identity migration when staff change — old `FORGELM_OPERATOR` IDs
   remain in the audit history immutably; new identity for new runs.

### 8.3 `risk_treatment_plan.md`

Outline (~250 lines):

Pre-populated risk register following the ISO 27005 risk-treatment
template:

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Treatment | Residual |
|----|------|------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| R-01 | Training-data poisoning (adversarial corpus) | Med | High | `forgelm audit` PII / secrets / quality scan; data fingerprint pinned in manifest; deployer pre-flight review | Med → Low |
| R-02 | Supply-chain compromise (compromised PyPI dep) | Low | High | SBOM; `pip-audit` nightly; `forgelm doctor` pre-flight | Low |
| R-03 | Credential leak (HF token in config / log) | Med | Med | `safe_post` mask; `[ingestion-pii-ml]` secrets scan; `_sanitize_md_list` in deployer instructions | Low |
| R-04 | Audit-log tampering | Low | High | Append-only + HMAC + manifest sidecar; `forgelm verify-audit` | Low |
| R-05 | Memorisation of removed PII (Article 17) | High | Med | `data.erasure_warning_memorisation` flag; `forgelm safety-eval` post-erasure | Med |
| R-06 | Safety-classifier load failure | Med | High | F-compliance-110 strict gate raises `ConfigError`; `audit.classifier_load_failed` event | Low |
| R-07 | Webhook SSRF / data exfiltration | Low | Med | `safe_post` SSRF guard; HTTPS-only; HMAC sign | Low |
| R-08 | ReDoS via `--type custom` regex | Low | Low | POSIX SIGALRM 30s budget in `_scan_file_with_alarm` | Low |
| R-09 | Cross-tool digest mismatch (purge vs reverse-pii) | Low | Med | Salted-SHA-256 reuse via `_resolve_salt`; `salt_source` in audit | Low |
| R-10 | Unauthorised model deployment | Med | High | `evaluation.require_human_approval` Article 14 gate; staging dir | Low |

Each row gets ~10 lines of detail in the published doc.

### 8.4 `statement_of_applicability.md`

Outline (~120 lines):

The §3 table reformatted as a QMS-style Statement of Applicability:

| Control | Applicable? | Justification | Implementation status (Wave 4) |
|---|---|---|---|
| A.5.1 Policies for information security | Applicable | EU AI Act Art. 17 mandates QMS | Implemented via `docs/qms/` SOPs |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Plus the explicit "excluded" rows (A.7 physical controls etc.) with
"Excluded — ForgeLM is a software toolkit, deployer infra-side
domain" justification.

## 9. Incident response runbook expansion (`sop_incident_response.md`)

**Current state:** 76 lines, focused on AI-safety incidents (model
produces harmful output, accuracy drop, formatting errors).

**Faz 23 additions:** ~80 new lines for security incidents:

1. **Audit chain integrity violation** — `forgelm verify-audit` exits
   non-zero. Runbook: isolate output_dir, capture `audit_log.jsonl`
   + `.manifest.json` + `.sha256` sidecar, contact security team,
   re-derive previous trusted state.
2. **Credential leak detected** — `forgelm audit` `_SECRET_PATTERNS`
   match in training corpus or webhook log. Runbook: rotate the leaked
   credential immediately, run `forgelm purge --row-id <leaked-row>`,
   flag the run as `data.erasure_warning_memorisation`.
3. **Supply-chain CVE flagged** — `pip-audit` nightly fails high-
   severity. Runbook: pin to safe version, rebuild SBOM, regenerate
   dependent artefacts, notify deployer if model already shipped.
4. **Webhook target compromised** — webhook recipient confirms breach.
   Runbook: rotate the webhook URL (read via `webhook.url_env`) and
   the destination-side bearer token; re-emit lifecycle events from
   the audit chain to confirm attacker did not splice events. (HMAC
   body signing is not yet implemented in ForgeLM — Phase 28+ backlog.)
5. **PII subject access request (Article 15)** — `forgelm reverse-pii`
   workflow + DSR response template.
6. **PII erasure request (Article 17)** — `forgelm purge` workflow +
   memorisation-warning communication template.

ISO mapping section gets added: A.5.24, A.5.25, A.5.26, A.5.27,
A.6.8, A.8.15, A.8.16.

## 10. Change management runbook expansion (`sop_change_management.md`)

**Current state:** 75 lines, focused on training-config changes
(major / minor / patch).

**Faz 23 additions:** ~60 new lines:

1. **CI gates as control** — explicit table of: ruff format / ruff
   check / pytest / parity strict / SBOM determinism / dry-run all
   green BEFORE merge. ISO A.8.32 mapping.
2. **Approval gate as Change Advisory Board substitute** — Article 14
   `forgelm approve` flow as the change-authorisation event. CC8.1
   mapping.
3. **Rollback procedure** — `auto_revert` for in-pipeline; manual
   redeploy of previous model SHA for post-deployment.
4. **Configuration drift detection** — `tools/regenerate_config_doc.py`
   diff-guard catches Pydantic-schema drift between code and docs.
5. **SBOM drift detection** — `tools/generate_sbom.py` deterministic
   contract: a release's SBOM is reproducible from the corresponding
   `git tag`.

## 11. Deployer-side audit cookbook (`iso_soc2_deployer_guide.md`)

**Outline (~400 lines):**

1. **Audience** — your compliance team responding to an ISO 27001
   internal audit OR a SOC 2 Type II observation period.
2. **What ForgeLM gives you out-of-the-box** — bullet list mapping
   to §3 + §4 of this design doc.
3. **Setup checklist before audit observation period:**
   - Set `FORGELM_OPERATOR` per CI runner.
   - Set `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET` from KMS (32+ random bytes).
   - Enable `evaluation.require_human_approval` for every high /
     unacceptable risk run.
   - Configure webhook to ship lifecycle events to SIEM.
   - Schedule weekly `forgelm verify-audit` cron.
4. **Walking the auditor through evidence:**
   - "Show me the audit trail" → `audit_log.jsonl` + `forgelm verify-audit`.
   - "Show me the change controls" → CI logs + `human_approval.granted`
     events + `config_hash` (per-run manifest sidecar field).
   - "Show me the data lineage" → `data_provenance.json`,
     `compute_dataset_fingerprint`, HF Hub revision pin.
   - "Show me the supply chain" → SBOM artefacts on every release tag.
   - "Show me the access controls" → `FORGELM_OPERATOR` rotation log
     + IdP MFA records.
   - "Show me the encryption posture" → `docs/qms/encryption_at_rest.md`

## 14. Acceptance criteria

Faz 22 (this design):

- [ ] **Length ≥ 800 lines** (closure-plan acceptance bar). This file
      will satisfy that on commit.
- [ ] **§3 covers all 93 ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls.** ✓ (37 + 8
      + 14 + 34 = 93).
- [ ] **§4 covers all 5 SOC 2 categories with full Common Criteria.** ✓.
- [ ] **§13 work breakdown is the canonical Faz 23 task list.** ✓.
- [ ] **Cited symbols are real.** ✓ (all symbols verified against
      `closure/wave4-integration` HEAD `b87c872`).
- [ ] **Bilingual parity unaffected.** ✓ (this file lives under
      `docs/analysis/` which is not in `_PAIRS`).
- [ ] **Adds zero behaviour change.** ✓ (design doc only).

Faz 23 (next phase, gated on this design landing):

See §13 above for the full task list. Acceptance: §13 checkboxes all
ticked + tests green + bilingual parity strict.

## 15. Out of scope for Faz 22 + 23

Items deferred to a later wave or explicitly out of plan:

- **PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST CSF mappings.** ISO + SOC 2 are the requested
  baseline; other frameworks share most controls and can re-use this
  evidence map but aren't authored as separate docs.
- **SPDX 2.3 SBOM generation.** CycloneDX 1.5 is the chosen format;
  SPDX is convertible via `cyclonedx-py` if required by a specific
  deployer.
- **External penetration test.** Operator responsibility; ForgeLM
  cannot pen-test itself.
- **Bug bounty programme.** Operator-org choice.
- **FedRAMP / IL5 government clouds.** Specialised compliance regime
  out of plan scope.

## 16. Decision log

Material decisions taken during Faz 22 authoring. Each row is a
contract that future authors should not silently reverse.

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Reversible? |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-22-01 | Customer-facing wording is **"alignment"**, not **"compliance"** / **"certified"** | Software cannot be certified; only organisations can. Mis-wording invites regulator pushback | No (legal cost; would require customer-facing retraction) |
| D-22-02 | SBOM stays CycloneDX 1.5; SPDX deferred | Existing Wave 2 emitter is pure-stdlib + zero external deps; CycloneDX 1.5 is the open-source-tooling default consumed by `Dependency-Track` | Yes — operator can convert via `cyclonedx-py` if SPDX is required |
| D-22-03 | `pip-audit` + `bandit` shipped as **`security`** optional extra (not core dep) | Core install stays lean; ops teams installing for CI/SCA opt in | Yes — promotion to core dep is one-line edit |
| D-22-04 | `bandit` runs only on `forgelm/` (not `tests/`) | Test fixtures legitimately use insecure patterns (assert, dummy keys, pickle); scanning them produces signal-noise | Yes — wider scope possible if `# nosec` annotations sweep is done first |
| D-22-05 | New QMS docs ship in Faz 23 as EN-only first; TR mirrors land in Faz 26 with the existing-QMS TR sweep | Avoid cross-wave doc-pair churn; Faz 26 is the canonical QMS bilingual phase | Yes — TR can land in Faz 23 if maintainer prefers single-wave delivery |
| D-22-06 | Statement of Applicability is a SUMMARY of §3, not a third copy of the table | Single source of truth (this design doc); the QMS SoA cites + references rather than duplicates | Yes |
| D-22-07 | Risk Treatment Plan rows are **pre-filled** from ForgeLM's own threat model | Deployer customises; ForgeLM-introduced risks are owner-known and shouldn't require deployer rediscovery | Yes |
| D-22-08 | Faz 23 does NOT add SPDX SBOM, FedRAMP mapping, NIST CSF mapping, HIPAA mapping | Closure-plan scope is ISO + SOC 2; other frameworks share evidence and re-use this map | Yes — additional mappings are pure additive |
| D-22-09 | Audit chain encryption-at-rest is **deployer responsibility** | ForgeLM's tamper-evidence is integrity-only; confidentiality is substrate-side | No (architecturally) — adding crypto would conflate concerns |
| D-22-10 | `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET` rotation is **deployer responsibility** + documented in `access_control.md` | Secret-management is KMS domain; ForgeLM consumes, doesn't manage | No (architecturally) |

## 17. FAQ for deployers

Anticipated questions from the deployer's compliance team:

**Q1.** *Is ForgeLM ISO 27001 certified?*
**A.** No. ISO 27001 certifies organisations, not software libraries.
ForgeLM is **aligned** with ISO 27001:2022 Annex A in that it produces
auditable evidence for 59 of the 93 controls (11 `FL` + 48
`FL-helps`). The remaining 34 controls (mainly A.7 physical,
A.5 organisational governance, A.8 network / cloud) are
deployer-side. See §3 for the full mapping.

**Q2.** *Is ForgeLM SOC 2 Type II compliant?*
**A.** Same answer as Q1. ForgeLM is **aligned** with the SOC 2
Trust Services Criteria — the deployer's auditor uses ForgeLM
evidence (audit log, model integrity, data fingerprint, SBOM,
approval-gate events, etc.) when assessing the deployer's controls.

**Q3.** *Where do I store `FORGELM_AUDIT_SECRET`?*
**A.** In your KMS / secrets vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets
Manager, Azure Key Vault). Inject via env var at CI runner start.
See `docs/qms/access_control.md` (Faz 23) for the rotation cadence
recommendation. Rotation must occur **between output-dir lifecycles**
(after archiving the current `audit_log.jsonl` + `.manifest.json`
pair), not mid-output-dir — every entry's HMAC is bound to the secret
live at emit time, and `forgelm verify-audit --require-hmac` cannot
verify a chain that mixes secrets.

**Q4.** *What encryption does ForgeLM apply at rest?*
**A.** None — ForgeLM is encryption-substrate-agnostic. The deployer
is responsible for disk / blob encryption. ForgeLM's audit chain is
**integrity-protected** (HMAC + manifest sidecar), which is
orthogonal to confidentiality. See `docs/qms/encryption_at_rest.md`
(Faz 23) for the recommended substrate per asset class.

**Q5.** *How do I respond to a GDPR Article 15 access request using
ForgeLM?*
**A.** `forgelm reverse-pii --query <subject-id> data/*.jsonl` (after
running with `--salt-source per_dir` if your corpus is hash-masked).
The audit event `data.access_request_query` records the request in
the chain (with the identifier salted-and-hashed, never raw).

**Q6.** *How do I respond to a GDPR Article 17 erasure request?*
**A.** `forgelm purge --row-id <subject-id> --corpus path/to/data.jsonl`.
The audit chain records the request + completion + any warnings
(`memorisation`, `synthetic_data_present`, `external_copies`). See
`docs/guides/gdpr_erasure.md` for the full workflow.

**Q7.** *Can ForgeLM help me pass a SOC 2 Type II observation?*
**A.** Yes — ForgeLM's audit log is HMAC-chained and append-only;
running `forgelm verify-audit` periodically (weekly cron is the
deployer-guide recommendation) provides continuous-monitoring
evidence. See §11 deployer guide outline.

**Q8.** *Where's the SBOM?*
**A.** Generated on every release tag (`v*` pattern) by
`tools/generate_sbom.py` and uploaded as a release artefact for each
(OS × Python-version) matrix cell. Format is CycloneDX 1.5 JSON.

**Q9.** *Does ForgeLM scan its own dependencies for CVEs?*
**A.** Yes — Faz 23 adds `pip-audit` to the nightly workflow.
High-severity CVEs fail the nightly; medium / low warn.

**Q10.** *Does ForgeLM perform static security analysis on its own
code?*
**A.** Yes — Faz 23 adds `bandit` to the CI workflow. Scope:
`forgelm/` (production code only). High severity fails CI.
