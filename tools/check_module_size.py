"""Wave 2-9 — module-size ceiling guard for ``forgelm/``.

The architecture standard
(:doc:`docs/standards/architecture.md`, "~1000-line ceiling is the
trigger for a sub-package split") sets a soft cap of **1000 lines of
code** per module under ``forgelm/``.  Beyond that, the file owns too
many concerns and should be split into a sub-package
(``module_name/`` directory with the same public import path).

This guard catches **future drift** without forcing an immediate
refactor of the modules that already sit over the ceiling, recorded
in :data:`_GRANDFATHERED_OVER_CEILING`.

Grandfather policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The initial seven entries (Wave 2-9, PR #29 HEAD audit) are tracked
for a v0.6.x sub-package split (see
``docs/roadmap/risks-and-decisions.md``).

New entries added after PR #29 are admitted **only** when the
sub-package split is non-trivial enough to materially risk
behavioural regression at the release-prep stage — i.e. the kind of
split that needs its own PR / Wave with isolated tests rather than
being bundled into a feature PR.  Every new entry MUST carry:

* an inline comment naming the **phase** + **release cycle** in
  which the split lands;
* a follow-up tracking artefact (roadmap entry, issue, or
  ``risks-and-decisions.md`` row) so the deferred work can't get
  lost.

The current addition beyond the original seven is
``forgelm/cli/_pipeline.py`` (Phase 14, v0.7.0; split tracked for
v0.7.x alongside the Phase 15 audit-package split pattern).  See
that file's inline comment in :data:`_GRANDFATHERED_OVER_CEILING`
below for the tracking pointer.

LOC metric
----------
The canonical metric is **non-blank, non-comment-only lines** —
i.e. the standard "code lines" notion used by ``cloc`` / ``tokei``.
Excluded from the count:

* Blank lines.
* Lines whose stripped content starts with ``#`` (pure-comment lines,
  including shebangs and the file-level ``# noqa`` markers).

Included (intentionally):

* Module / class / function docstrings.  They are part of the file's
  review burden — a 600-line docstring still represents 600 lines of
  prose someone has to maintain — and excluding them would let
  contributors silently grow a module by inflating its docstrings.

Thresholds
----------
* **Warn at ``> 1000``** — non-fatal in default mode.  The guard
  prints a one-line warning per offender; CI may surface this as a
  soft signal.
* **Fail at ``> 1500``** — fatal (exit 1) for non-grandfathered
  modules.  A 50% over-ceiling module is an architectural emergency.
* ``--strict`` mode promotes the warn threshold to a fatal one for
  non-grandfathered modules.  Grandfathered modules continue to emit
  WARN (with the "v0.6.x defer" hint) regardless of mode.

Exit codes (per the ``tools/`` contract — NOT the public 0/1/2/3/4
surface that ``forgelm/`` honours):

* ``0`` — no NEW drift; every over-threshold module is grandfathered.
* ``1`` — at least one NEW over-threshold module (or ``--strict``
  applied to a NEW over-warn module), or invalid arguments.

Usage::
