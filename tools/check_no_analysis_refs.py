"""CI guard — public-tree files must not reference gitignored working-memory.

Scans every file under the project's public tree (forgelm/, docs/ excluding
the gitignored directories themselves, tests/, tools/, site/, plus the
top-level README.md / CHANGELOG.md / CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md) and
fails the run when it finds a citation or hyperlink into ``docs/marketing/``
or ``docs/analysis/``.

The rationale lives in ``docs/standards/documentation.md`` ("Working-memory
directories"): those two directories are operator-local research and
audit notes that never appear in fresh clones, so any reference rots
into a 404 the moment the maintainer touches it.

Path-string exemptions
----------------------
Production code (e.g. ``_SKIP_PATH_FRAGMENTS`` in
``tools/check_yaml_snippets.py``) names ``docs/analysis/`` as a directory
filter — that is the OPPOSITE of a content reference, it tells the linter
to descend AROUND those paths.  The exemption list below carries those
known-correct uses.  Add to it only with a written justification in the
comment block immediately above the entry.

Run via::

    python tools/check_no_analysis_refs.py

Exit codes (per ``tools/`` contract — NOT the public 0/1/2/3/4 surface
that ``forgelm/`` honours):

- ``0`` — clean
- ``1`` — at least one prohibited reference found

# Two alternatives:
#

#    look-behind keeps us from matching ``docs-analysis-…`` style
#    identifiers.
#
# 2. ``(analysis|marketing)/<segment>`` — relative form.  The
#    ``<segment>`` is required to either continue with another path
#    separator or terminate with a known file extension; that
#    distinguishes a path (``analysis/code_reviews/x.md``,
#    ``marketing/strategy/``) from English prose that uses ``/`` as
#    "or" (e.g. ``marketing/product copy``, ``analysis/report
#    output``).  Without this constraint the broad form caught
#    legitimate noun-phrase uses of slash in standards docs.  Newly-
#    created working-memory subfolders are still caught because they
#    inevitably either contain another ``/`` or end with a file
