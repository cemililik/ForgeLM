"""Phase 15 Task 3 — language-specific glyph-fallback normalisation for pypdf.

Some PDFs use Type-1 PostScript fonts whose ``Encoding`` dictionary maps
non-ASCII characters via custom glyph names that pypdf's CMap fallback
cannot resolve. pypdf produces what it can — typically Latin-1 placeholder
glyphs that look nothing like the source character. The 2026-05-11
ingestion-reliability audit measured this on a real-world Turkish-language
formal-publication PDF: Turkish characters surfaced as ``ø Õ ú ÷ ࡟`` etc.,
with ~7 % corrupt-char ratio on the front-matter pages and a chapter-level
section using ``U+085F`` (Mandaic punctuation) for bullet points.

This module ships a small, **language-specific** lookup table that maps
the measured corrupt glyphs back to their correct Turkish characters,
plus a profile dispatcher so future phases can drop in additional
profiles (Arabic, CJK) without re-shaping the API.

Design rules:

* **Pure data, no I/O.** The table is a module-level constant so it is
  trivially testable and adds no import-time cost.
* **Single-pass replacement.** :func:`apply_profile` uses one ``str``
  scan per profile so even a megabyte-sized chunk normalises in linear
  time. The previous draft used a regex-alternation; the dict approach
  is simpler and avoids the cost of building a giant pattern.
* **Order matters.** A handful of the measured artefacts are
  *multi-character* sequences (e.g. ``ö`` followed by a trailing space
  for ``Ğ``). The applier handles those before the single-char passes
  so a single-char substitution does not break the multi-char hit.
* **Opt-out per profile.** Callers pass ``profile="none"`` to disable
  normalisation entirely; the function returns the input unchanged.

The public surface is intentionally minimal — one function and one
``PROFILES`` map. The doctor diagnostic (Phase 15 task 3 acceptance)
loads :data:`PROFILES` and reports ``pypdf_normalise.<profile>: pass``
so an operator can verify the table is intact without running an ingest.

``turkish`` is the only language-specific profile shipped today; future

Phase 15 round-1 review (C-2): the original default of ``turkish``
silently rewrote legitimate non-Turkish letters (``Bjørk`` → ``BjİrkĞ``,
``Õrö`` collapse) because the normaliser fires regardless of the
operator's language hint. The fix is to default to ``none`` and let
the CLI dispatcher derive the right profile from ``--language-hint``:
``--language-hint tr`` auto-selects ``turkish`` unless
``--normalise-profile`` is set explicitly; every other hint stays on
``none``. Operators on a Turkish corpus continue to get the benefit
without having to know the flag's name; everyone else is safe by
default.
