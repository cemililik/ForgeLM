"""Versioned API contract for the ``forgelm`` library surface.

Phase 19 (Library API).  Two version strings live here so consumers
can pin against either independently:

- ``__version__`` — the package version (mirrors what
  ``importlib.metadata.version("forgelm")`` returns; sourced from
  pyproject.toml at install time, overridden to ``"0.0.0+dev"`` for
  raw-source checkouts).
- ``__api_version__`` — the *public Python API* contract version, bumped
  when a stable symbol's signature changes (additions are minor, removals
  / signature changes are major).  Consumers that depend on the library
  API can pin against this without coupling to the CLI version.

Per ``docs/design/library_api.md`` §4.3, the two versions track separately because the CLI surface and the
Python API have different stability windows — the CLI may grow new
subcommands without affecting library consumers, and library additions
do not necessarily ship a new CLI feature.

# Anchored at 1.0.0 with the v0.5.5 release (first PyPI publish of
# the formal Phase 19 library-API surface — 30 stable symbols in
# ``forgelm.__all__``).  v0.5.6 reverted the v0.5.5 torch min bump;
# v0.5.7 fixes a runtime ``SFTConfig.max_seq_length`` TypeError on
# modern trl (rename to ``max_length`` in trl 0.13+).  Neither patch
# changes the Python API surface, so ``__api_version__`` stays at 1.0.0.
