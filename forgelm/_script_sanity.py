"""Phase 15 Task 2 — Unicode / script sanity check for extracted text.

Runs **after** every per-file extraction. For a language hint (e.g.
``"tr"`` for Turkish), counts the ratio of code points that fall outside
the language's expected Unicode blocks (plus a small allow-list of
universal punctuation / digits / ASCII whitespace) and emits a single
operator-facing ``WARNING`` when the ratio crosses the configured
threshold.

Why this exists: pypdf's font-fallback failures (audit §1.2 / §1.3) and
mis-decoded TXT files produce text that *parses* but is full of
out-of-script garbage — the 2026-05-11 pilot measured ≈ 7 % corrupt-char
ratio on the front-matter pages of a Turkish PDF and 100 % U+085F bullet
glyphs on a chapter-level section. Both classes of failure would be
caught by a single Unicode-block sanity check.

Design rules:

* **No new heavy deps.** Block detection uses :func:`unicodedata.name`
  (stdlib) plus a small per-language allow-list. ``langdetect`` (already
  shipped under ``[ingestion]``) is not invoked here — the check runs
  whether or not a language was auto-detected, because the operator
  supplies the hint explicitly via ``--language-hint``.
* **Fail-soft.** The check never raises and never blocks ingestion;
  it logs a warning and surfaces structured metrics in ``notes_structured``
  so machine-driven pipelines can react without grepping log lines.
* **Calibrated default threshold.** The 2026-05-11 audit measured ~7 %
  corruption on the worst-case pages and 0 % on clean body. The
  documented placeholder of 0.5 % in the audit was intentionally
  aggressive; we ship a calibrated **1.5 %** default that catches the
  pilot's two-chunk front-matter corruption (~7 % ratio) and the
  bullet-glyph chapter (~3 % ratio over 17 chunks) while leaving room
  for legitimate mixed-script content (Turkish corpora with English
  code samples sit comfortably under 1 %).
* **Profile-aware.** Code points the normaliser is allowed to produce
  (per ``forgelm._pypdf_normalise.emitted_codepoints``) are considered
  in-script even when they fall outside the strict per-language block
  list — otherwise the warning would fire on every successful
  normalisation pass.

Public surface: one function (:func:`check_script_sanity`) and one
constant (:data:`DEFAULT_THRESHOLD`).
