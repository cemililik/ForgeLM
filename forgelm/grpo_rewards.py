"""Built-in GRPO reward functions used when no learned reward model is wired.

These rewards exist so the bundled ``grpo-math`` quickstart (and any other
prompt-only GRPO config that does not declare ``training.grpo_reward_model``)
can train without crashing inside ``trl.GRPOTrainer``, which requires the
``reward_funcs`` argument to be a callable / list of callables / HF model id.

Two complementary signals are provided:

* :func:`format_match_reward` — 1.0 when a completion ends with the literal
  pattern ``Answer: <value>`` (case-insensitive, optional trailing units and
  whitespace). 0.0 otherwise. This is what every prompt in the
  ``grpo-math`` template asks the model to produce.
* :func:`length_shaping_reward` — ``min(len(completion) / 200, 1.0)``. Gives
  the model a non-zero gradient signal during the first few thousand steps
  before format compliance kicks in; clipped at 1.0 so the model can't game
  it by producing arbitrarily long output.

The default :func:`combined_format_length_reward` is the linear combination
``0.8 * format + 0.2 * length`` — format dominates, length keeps the gradient
non-flat early in training.

All functions follow TRL's reward-callable contract: ``(completions: list[str],
**kwargs) -> list[float]``. They are kept at module level (no closures) so
``GRPOTrainer`` can pickle them across worker processes without dragging
trainer state into the spawn.

Reward range
------------

GRPOTrainer accepts a list of reward callables and **sums** their per-completion
outputs. ForgeLM's built-in wiring is additive, so the effective range depends
on whether the dataset carries gold answers:

* **Without ``gold_answer``** — only :func:`combined_format_length_reward` is
  registered, so total per-completion reward ∈ ``[0, 1.0]``.
* **With ``gold_answer``** — :func:`combined_format_length_reward` is paired
  with the math correctness reward (``forgelm.trainer._math_reward_fn``). The
  two are summed by TRL, so total per-completion reward ∈ ``[0, 2.0]``.

**Implication for tuning:** learning rate and KL coefficient (``beta``) tuned
against the 0–1 branch generally need to be revisited for the 0–2 branch — the
advantage magnitudes roughly double, which interacts with KL pull and clip
ranges. If a single training run mixes prompts with and without ``gold_answer``,
consider clamping the combined output or down-weighting the correctness reward
to keep the scale stable.

**Wiring pointers:** ``forgelm.trainer._dataset_has_gold_answers`` decides which
branch is used; ``forgelm.trainer._build_trainer`` (GRPO branch) is where the
reward callables are assembled and passed to ``trl.GRPOTrainer``.

# strip trailing whitespace before matching (so the tail collapses to a
