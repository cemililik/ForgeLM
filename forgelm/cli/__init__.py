"""Public re-exports for the ``forgelm`` CLI package.

This facade preserves the pre-Faz-15 ``forgelm.cli`` import surface — the
tests, the ``forgelm`` console script, and the
``python -m forgelm.cli`` entry point all keep resolving against this
module.

Every name re-exported here is part of the load-bearing contract:

- Public exit codes consumed by CI/CD pipelines.
- ``parse_args`` / ``main`` as the entry-point pair.
- The handful of underscore-prefixed helpers that tests reach via
  ``from forgelm.cli import _name`` or ``patch("forgelm.cli._name", ...)``
  — the dotted path must resolve *here* for monkeypatch to work.

The package layout matches the cohesion ceiling in
:doc:`docs/standards/architecture` — each sub-module owns one concern,
with this facade keeping the historical import surface intact.
