"""Shared torch / NumPy ABI compatibility probe.

Used in two places with two different contracts:

- :mod:`forgelm.cli.subcommands._doctor` wraps the verdict in a
  ``_CheckResult`` for the ``numpy.torch_abi`` probe (informational
  diagnostic — pass / fail with details).
- :mod:`forgelm.cli._training` calls it as an **early-fail gate** before
  the training pipeline imports torch heavily.  Detecting the mismatch
  here means the operator sees an actionable remediation message
  ("``pip install 'numpy<2'``") instead of a cryptic
  ``NameError: name '_C' is not defined`` mid-training.

The check itself: torch < 2.3 was compiled against NumPy 1.x and silently
degrades when paired with NumPy 2.x (the well-known ``_ARRAY_API not
found`` UserWarning from torch's C++ tensor-numpy bridge).  Intel Mac
(x86_64) is the platform where this routinely bites — PyTorch Foundation
no longer publishes torch >= 2.3 wheels for that target.  v0.5.7 ships a
PEP 508 marker in ``pyproject.toml`` that pins ``numpy<2`` on Intel Mac
for fresh installs; this preflight catches the residual cases (env
manually drifted; user installed torch out-of-band).
