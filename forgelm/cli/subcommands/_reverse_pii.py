"""``forgelm reverse-pii`` — GDPR Article 15 right-of-access subcommand.

Phase 38 closure of GH-014.  Companion to ``forgelm purge`` (Phase 21,
Article 17 right-to-erasure): where ``purge`` lets a data subject ask
"delete my row," ``reverse-pii`` lets the same subject ask "is my row
in the corpus at all, and if so, where?"

The subcommand walks a glob of JSONL corpora and reports every line
where a supplied identifier (e-mail, phone, TR national ID, custom
regex, or hash-masked digest) appears.  Two complementary scan modes:

1. **Plaintext residual scan** (default).  Searches for the identifier
   as a literal substring (``re.escape`` applied; the dot in
   ``alice@example.com`` is a literal dot, not "any character") — the
   path that surfaces *mask leaks* (operator believed the corpus was
   masked but a residual span was missed by the masking pass).  This
   is the audit-time honest-PII check.
2. **Hash-mask scan** (``--salt-source per_dir`` or ``--salt-source
   env_var``).  Computes ``SHA256(salt + identifier)`` using the same
   per-output-dir salt that ``forgelm purge`` uses for its
   ``target_id`` hashing, then searches every JSONL line for that
   digest.  This mode targets corpora that an external pipeline masked
   by embedding ``SHA256(salt + identifier)`` digests.  ForgeLM itself
   does not ship a hash-replacement ingest strategy; this mode is for
   operators who built one outside the toolkit using purge's salt.

Audit chain: every invocation writes a ``data.access_request_query``
event with the identifier *salted-and-hashed* (never raw — Article 15
access requests must not themselves leak the subject's identifier
into the audit log; the salt comes from the same per-output-dir
file purge uses, so a wordlist attack against the audit log would
require the operator's salt file too) and the per-file match count.
An operator who later runs ``forgelm verify-audit`` sees a forensic
record that the request was processed without the audit log itself
becoming a residual leak.  Cross-tool correlation: the digest written
here matches the ``target_id`` digest ``forgelm purge`` writes for
the same identifier in the same output_dir, so a compliance reviewer
auditing "every event about subject X" sees a single connected
timeline.

Exit codes (per ``docs/standards/error-handling.md``):

- 0 — command ran (matches reported, may be empty).
- 1 — config error (empty/whitespace ``--query``, unparseable regex
  for ``--type custom``, glob pattern resolved to zero files,
  ``--salt-source`` requested without the matching salt source
  available).
- 2 — runtime error (I/O failure walking the corpus, audit-log write
  failure when an audit dir was supplied, custom-regex ReDoS timeout,
  malformed UTF-8 mid-corpus, audit-init failure when --audit-dir was
  explicitly supplied).

    We reuse the per-output-dir salt that ``forgelm purge`` uses for
    its ``target_id`` hashing (F-W3-PS-01).  Two consequences:

    1. A wordlist attack against the audit log requires the operator's
