"""Single-source audit-log JSONL reader for the approval / approvals / purge family.

Background — Wave 2a Round-1 review (XPR-01) flagged that ForgeLM had three
near-identical JSONL parsers across :mod:`._approve` and :mod:`._approvals`,
with a fourth coming in Phase 21 (``forgelm purge``).  Each copy duplicated
the malformed-line accounting, the OSError handling, and the
``isinstance(event, dict)`` guard — so a future fix to any one of those
policies (e.g. switching to streaming reads, adding a maximum line length,
emitting structured error events) would have to be applied in ``N``
places at once.

This module is the single place that policy lives.  Two helpers cover the
two read patterns the family uses:

- :func:`iter_audit_events` — generator yielding ``(line_number, event)``
  pairs.  Two parsing modes: ``strict=False`` (default) skips malformed
  entries and emits a single summary warning at end (best for ``--pending``
  enumeration where partial corruption shouldn't bail).  ``strict=True``
  raises :class:`AuditLogParseError` on the first malformed entry (best
  for approve / reject decision guards where silently skipping a corrupted
  decision record could cause a wrong "approval not yet granted" verdict).
- :func:`find_latest_event_for_run` — convenience wrapper that returns the
  most-recent event matching a predicate, or ``None``.  Used by the
  approve / reject decision-guard checks; defaults to ``strict=True`` so
  decision lookups fail fast on log corruption.

Both helpers route OSError on file-open through the module logger and
return an empty result so the caller sees a missing log as "no matching
event" rather than as a crash.

**Performance note (Wave 2a Round-2 review F-INFRA-01):** both helpers are
``O(n)`` over the full audit log per call.  Live-tested at 10K events:
~42 ms per walk on Python 3.11.  Multi-tenant operator dirs that accumulate
audit events for a year may trip into seconds-per-call territory — at that
scale, callers should batch their lookups (do a single ``iter_audit_events``
walk and accumulate all needed events) rather than calling
``find_latest_event_for_run`` repeatedly.

**Deliberate scope (Wave 2a Round-2 review F-XPR-01-01):**
``forgelm/compliance.py::verify_audit_log`` keeps its own JSONL parser
because it must hash the *raw line bytes* for SHA-256 chain verification;
this module yields decoded ``dict`` events without preserving raw bytes,
so the verifier cannot adopt it as-is.  That divergence is intentional and
documented.  If a future refactor extends ``iter_audit_events`` to
optionally yield ``(line_no, raw_line, event)`` tuples, the verifier can
adopt the shared parser.

    - ``strict=False`` (default): skips blank lines, malformed JSON, and
      non-dict roots silently.  Emits a single ``logger.warning`` at the
      end summarising the skip count (so callers learn about corruption
      without paying per-line log cost).  Use this for enumeration paths

    - ``strict=True``: raises :class:`AuditLogParseError` on the first
      malformed entry.  Use this for paths where silently skipping a
      corrupted record could cause a wrong verdict (e.g. approve / reject
      decision guards: a corrupted ``human_approval.granted`` line that
      gets skipped looks identical to "no approval yet" and would
      double-grant on the operator's next attempt).

      legitimately has no audit log yet); or
    - the file cannot be opened (OSError logged at ERROR level so
      operators see why nothing came through).

    the file handle via ``with`` and releases it on iterator exhaustion.
