"""Phase 12.5: optional Presidio ML-NER PII adapter.

Layered ON TOP of :func:`forgelm.data_audit.detect_pii` (regex). The two
detectors return disjoint category sets so the merged ``pii_summary``
shows both the structured-identifier signal (regex) and the
unstructured-identifier signal (ML) without double-counting the same
span.

Optional-deps gating: every runtime guard reads from
:mod:`forgelm.data_audit._optional` via attribute lookup (``_optional._HAS_PRESIDIO``)
rather than a value-time ``from . import _HAS_PRESIDIO``, so tests can
patch ``forgelm.data_audit._optional._HAS_PRESIDIO`` and the patched
boolean is observed by every callsite in this module.
