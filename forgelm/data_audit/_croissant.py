"""Phase 12.5: Google Croissant 1.0 dataset-card emission.

Croissant is a JSON-LD vocabulary built on top of schema.org;
mlcommons.org/croissant describes the canonical context. We emit a
minimum-viable subset that's valid against the spec — tools that consume
Croissant (HuggingFace's dataset-cards, Croissant validator, MLCommons
reference loaders) can parse the block without modification, while the
rest of the audit JSON stays untouched. The card lives under the new
``croissant`` key on the :class:`AuditReport` dataclass; callers that
don't want it never see it.
