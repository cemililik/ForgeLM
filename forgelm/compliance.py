          we cannot deliver). The SHA-256 chain still detects modification.
        - **Post-write hash advancement**: ``self._prev_hash`` is updated
          only after the line lands on disk so a write failure leaves the
          chain intact for a retry.

      ``sha256(prior_full_line_json).hexdigest()`` — including any ``_hmac``
      field present on the prior line, since the chain is computed over the
      *post-HMAC* line as written.
    - When ``hmac_secret`` is provided, each entry's ``_hmac`` field is
      verified as ``HMAC-SHA256(key, entry_json_without_hmac)`` where
      ``key = sha256(secret + run_id).digest()`` (operator's per-run key).

    Args:
        path: Path to the ``audit_log.jsonl`` file.
        hmac_secret: Optional operator secret. When provided, HMAC tags on
            each line are verified. Lines lacking an ``_hmac`` field are
            tolerated (the writer omits the field when no secret is set)
            unless ``require_hmac=True``.
        require_hmac: When ``True``, every entry must carry a valid
            ``_hmac`` field — a missing tag fails verification. Used by the
            CLI's ``--require-hmac`` flag for strict enterprise audits.

    Returns:
        :class:`VerifyResult`. ``valid=True`` only when the chain is intact
        end-to-end (and HMAC tags pass when a secret was supplied / required).

    Notes:
        Reads the log line-by-line (streaming) so RAM usage stays
        bounded for large logs. Genesis-manifest sidecar
        (``<path>.manifest.json``) is checked when present.
