"""Centralized HTTP discipline for outbound HTTP calls (GET / HEAD / POST).

Extracted from ``webhook._post_payload`` to enforce SSRF guard, redirect
refusal, ``http://`` refusal, timeout floor, and secret-mask error reasons
across every outbound HTTP call site in the codebase (webhook, judge,
synthetic, doctor).  POST traffic goes through :func:`safe_post`; read-side
GET / HEAD traffic goes through :func:`safe_get` (added in Wave 2a Round-2
when ``forgelm doctor`` migrated off ``urllib.request.urlopen``).

Future call sites (telemetry, registry pings, etc.) MUST go through one of
those helpers rather than calling ``requests.{post,get,head}`` (or
``urllib.request.urlopen`` / ``httpx.*``) directly — the CI acceptance
gate ``lint-http-discipline`` greps ``forgelm/`` for those patterns and
fails on any hit outside ``forgelm/_http.py``:

    grep -rn "requests\\.\\(post\\|get\\|head\\)\\(" forgelm/ | grep -v _http\\.py
    grep -rn "urllib\\.request\\.urlopen\\(" forgelm/ | grep -v _http\\.py

both must stay empty.

Policy summary (each enforced before the network call):

* **Scheme** — ``https://`` required by default; ``http://`` rejected unless
  the caller passes ``allow_insecure_http=True`` (only the operator-blessed
  webhook path uses this; judge / synthetic always require TLS).
* **SSRF** — RFC1918, loopback, link-local (incl. cloud IMDS at
  ``169.254.169.254``), reserved, and multicast destinations are blocked
  unless ``allow_private=True``. Hostnames are pre-resolved via
  ``socket.getaddrinfo`` so a DNS name pointing at a private IP also trips.
* **Timeout floor** — defaults to 10s; callers can pass ``min_timeout`` to
  lower the floor (the webhook path uses 1s to preserve historical
  behaviour). ``timeout=0`` / ``None`` is always rejected — ``requests``
  honours those as "block forever".
* **Redirects** — ``allow_redirects=False`` always. The SSRF guard runs
  against the *initial* hostname; following a 30x to a private IP would
  bypass it.
* **TLS** — ``verify=True`` by default; pass ``ca_bundle="/path/..."`` for a
  custom CA store (corporate MITM CA on regulated estates).
* **Header masking** — ``Authorization`` / ``X-API-Key`` values are redacted
  from the warning log emitted when the request raises.

# Issue #14 — DNS-rebinding-safe destination resolver
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``_is_private_destination`` above pre-resolves the host and answers a
# yes/no question, but the actual ``requests.post`` call then does its OWN
# DNS lookup at connect time.  Between those two lookups an attacker-
# controlled DNS server can flip the answer (TTL=0 + rebinding to
# 127.0.0.1 / 169.254.169.254), letting the payload + bearer token leak
# to a private destination after passing the guard.  The resolver below
# closes that window by returning a concrete public IP literal that the
# call site uses to build the URL — requests then connects to that IP
# without a second DNS round-trip.

    Returns ``(ip, None)`` when the host is a public destination, or

    The caller substitutes the returned IP literal into the request URL
    so ``requests`` does not re-resolve the hostname — this is the fix
    for the DNS-rebinding TOCTOU described in issue #14.  The original

    HTTPS) by the caller; this helper only owns the resolve+validate
