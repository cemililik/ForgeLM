"""Phase 15 Wave 2 Task 11 — operator-supplied strip-pattern with ReDoS guard.

The ``--strip-pattern REGEX`` flag lets operators delete known-boilerplate
lines that ForgeLM's automatic dedup heuristic misses (running headers
with varying content, watermark lines, DOI / journal headers, etc.).
Because the pattern is **operator-controlled**, two failure modes have
to be ruled out before the ingestion run starts:

1. **Pathological back-tracking** — e.g. ``(a+)+b`` against a long
   string of ``a`` characters is the textbook ReDoS shape. Validating
   the pattern up-front at CLI parse time catches the most common
   anti-patterns described in ``docs/standards/regex.md`` (rules 4 + 6).
2. **Run-time hang** — even a pattern that *looks* safe can hit a
   degenerate input. A SIGALRM-based timeout per regex bounds the
   worst-case match cost; on Windows + non-main threads the timeout is
   a no-op and the operator is expected to vet the pattern themselves
   (same trade-off ``forgelm reverse-pii --type custom`` makes).

The public surface is intentionally small:

* :func:`validate_strip_pattern` — CLI-time structural validation.
* :func:`compile_strip_patterns` — turn a list of validated patterns
  into compiled :class:`re.Pattern` objects.
* :func:`apply_strip_patterns` — strip every matching span (or whole
  line, in MULTILINE mode) with a per-pattern SIGALRM guard.
* :class:`StripPatternError` — single exception type the CLI catches.

This module imports only stdlib so it can run before any ingestion
extras are installed.

    ``(\\w+\\s+)+`` — explodes on adversarial input even when CPython's
    engine is "well-behaved" in practice. Phase 15 round-1 review (S-1)
    found the original backward-walk validator skipped the escape-shape
    variants because stepping past a ``\\`` consumed the matching ``(``;
    the rewrite below walks **forward atom-by-atom**, tracking per
    group whether the most recently parsed atom was unbounded
    (quantified with ``+`` / ``*``). When a group's closing ``)`` is
    immediately followed by another ``+`` / ``*``, that is the
    nested-unbounded shape and we reject.

    The check is structural, not a full-AST parse — regex.md rule 4
    is about pattern *shape*, so an atom-by-atom forward scan is
    sufficient. The SIGALRM timeout remains the safety net for the
    long tail of exotic variants we still miss. Atom parsing and the
    close-paren handler are extracted into helpers (``_scan_atom_end``,
    ``_close_group_or_raise``, ``_advance_past_brace_quantifier``) to
    keep this function below Sonar S3776's cognitive-complexity ceiling.

    Scope (post-round-3 review S-A):
        This validator covers the **nested** unbounded shape
        documented in ``docs/standards/regex.md`` rule 4 — i.e. a
        group whose last atom carries ``+`` / ``*`` AND whose
        closing ``)`` is itself followed by another ``+`` / ``*``.
        Adjacent / sequential unbounded shapes (``(.+?)(.+)``,
        ``(?:a|b)+(c|d)+``, ``(.+?)[ \\t]*$``) are also mentioned
        by regex.md rule 4 but are **not** caught here. They
        empirically do not backtrack catastrophically under
        CPython 3.10–3.13 on adversarial 100-char input (verified
        in the round-3 review), so they fall back on the per-pattern
        SIGALRM timeout as the runtime safety net. Operators on
        non-CPython runtimes (PyPy 7.x, Pyston) should treat the
        SIGALRM net as the primary defence and consider replacing
        adjacent-quantified patterns with bounded alternatives.
